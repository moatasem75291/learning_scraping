Sort of.Now. It's your choicewhether you quit or not.And I have to admit coachingyou has given mea second chance to seea dream fulfilled.But I don't want you to be likeme and make a wrong decision.Quit for the right reasons.You know I see you look atyourself.I see you feel like you'renot like the other kids.I'm telling you Maddy.Your talent, your physique,most of all your heartmeans that you are 10 timesmore talented than Chelseaand all her friendsput together.Quit if you want to.But don't be like me andwaste your talent becauseof what others think.What about the medal?Keep it.That's right.Swapping over.Good.

Maddy, wait up.I realize I was wrong!I shouldn't have made fun of youlike that.What are you doing now, Chelsea?Still trying to milk more funout of it?No, I was trying to apologize.Maddy? Sorry about yesterday.I didn't know!Spare me the details.I saw what happened.But I didn't mean to hurt you.- Well, you did!And I don't want youaround anymore.I told Kate and Shane I don'twant you at training either.But it wasn't my fault!Maddy?Maddy? Maddy?Maddy?What you doing, buddy?Ahhh, glutton for morepunishment, eh?I heard what you said to Chelseaafter her stunt.
