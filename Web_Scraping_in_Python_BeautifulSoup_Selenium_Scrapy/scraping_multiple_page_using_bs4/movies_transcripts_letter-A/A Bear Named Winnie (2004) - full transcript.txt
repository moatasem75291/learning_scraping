girl.You'll be fine here, OK?Good-bye.Good-bye, Winnie.Forgive my impertinence, Harry, but you're notCanadian-born, are you?Or rather, I-- I mean I canjust detect a slight hint of--My father diedwhen I was young.Mother remarried.I was sent out here at 14.My uncle's withthe grain exchange.That's interesting.Is it?No, no, no, no, no, no.No, it's nothing really.I just--Nothing?If a simple veterinarianfrom Winnipeg, Manitoba,is interesting at all,I want to know about it.Well, it's simply that, um, what I find interestingis that--well, your sensitivity towardsWinnie being abandoned when--when you've experiencedsomething similaryourself, in a manner ofspeaking, more or less.My good old dad came out herewith a piddling remittance.You know, the black sheep ofthe family, the feckless son whojust couldn't measure up, and sent to the new worldto seek his fortune.And unfortunatelyhis family was right.And my mother, well, she taughtschool, and she still does.All of which I supposeexplains why I--I can speak Latin, but Ican't swim or throw a ball.When this rotten war is over,no more soldiering for me.When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be.No more churchparades on Sunday.No more putting in for leave.I shall miss that SergeantMajor, how I'll miss him,how he'll grieve.When this rotten war is over, no more soldiering for me.When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be.I shall sound my own reveille.I shall make my own tattoo.Now this, I must have.I can't do without.You know, it's al-- it's alwaysDickens or-- or Longfellow.Do you find?I find that it--No!Winnie!Where did you come from?Winnie!That's-- that's Winnie!She-- She's here, but Ithought that you-- well,it is good that she's here?No, it's not.It's not so good, but it'scertainly extraordinary.Whoa, what areyou going to do?Because I mean, she'snot so wild anymore.She obviously likes people.We can't?No.Wh-- wh-- yeah, but we can'ttake her with us, either.We-- I mean, whatare you going to do?Smuggle her in your--in your haversack?This is not good.I hope this works.Private.Leonard, right?Well, Leonard--Let's-- let's go.Over there.We got this, Jake.A big strappingfellow such as yourself.Left.Right.Left.Right.Left.Right.Left.In a few weeks you will standagainst the Prussian army,the greatest, strongest, mostprofessional, well-trainedmilitary machine in the world.I suggest over the next weekyou take a few moments to planhow you intend to stay alive.Left.Right.Left.Right.Left.Right.Left.Here,have one of these.Oh, lovely.Our-- our dressing stationsare well behind our lines,so we're not going tosee any real action.Technically we're still in rangeof their guns so there's alwaysthe off-chance--One-ton shell mightblow us into next year.Right.But what are the odds?What-- What do you think, Harry?Wh-- What are the odds?I think I've madea terrible blunder.We can't take Winnie to war.To the front line?- No.She'll end uplike old Sir Hugo.Or worse.You're right.Harry.What I'm trying to figure is, if Zeb's back to his old self,then there must be a reason whyyou want to keep him inside.Well, I don't think anotherday or two of reprievewould hurt.Would it, Taylor?Oh.No, no, no.Wait.I-- I think I know.It-- it's becauseof her, isn't it?Yes, it is.It's-- it's because you don'twant Winnie getting lonely,because boy oh boy,if she gets lonely,then the first thing she'sgoing to do is run to camp.And then the Coloneland everybody--Thank you, Taylor.Sorry, Harry.Just uh, just had towork that out a bit, huh?Just, just work it out.The front is no placefor you either, is it?Huh?Old man.Now you be a brave bearand look after Taylor.We'll be back as soonas we can, all right?You know what to doif the brass turns up.Sure do.Girl.We should getthere in plenty of time.Wait, wait,wait a minute.We never discussed we.It was always you.The situation's changed.It needs to be we.What?In any event it willbe a walk in the park.Harry, I'm afraidI'm not terribly brave.Haha, you'll get over that.No, one does notget over a firing squad.Sir.Sir.Excuse me, sir.Sir.Canadian Army, VeterinaryCorps, Winnipeg Sectionready for inspection, sir!At ease, Corporal.Where is she?I have no ideawhat you mean, sir.No idea whatsoever?Well, yes, sir.Well, no, sir.I-- no idea whatsoever, sir.Very well.I know she was on the boat.I have evidence, andI know she's here.And when I get to the bottom ofall of this, the bunch of youwill be finding yourselvesfacing disgrace, dishonor,and a punishment so cruelonly English schoolboyscould have thought of it.Do you understand?Yes, sir.Understand, sir.No idea whatsoever, sir.Barret.This is uh, thisis from Whitehall.And uh, ha!I don't know what--I mean, what thehell do they know.I know they need the because apparently it'smachine guns that aregoing to win this war.Listen."Each one replaces 80 rifles."Codswallop, isn't it?I mean, what--and what if it jams?Eh?What then?Well, no, sir.Thank you very much.I'll take the 80 riflesand a crack cavalry.It's horses that arekey to this fight.And they always have been, and they always will be.What do you think, Colonel?General, may I speak candidly?Crawford.Sir!General, I recommend youlift your ban on alcoholfor our boys andloosen the restrictionsyou've imposed with regardto leaving the base.Impose?I don't impose orders, boy.I give 'em.And I expect them to befollowed by everyone.Sir, the men need to letoff steam every now and then.Yeah, and it's,um, it's clean livingthat keeps my lads sharp, and that means no liquor.And if they have to golooking for it off-base,well, they'll be shot.Will that be all, Colonel?Men prepared to sacrificetheir lives for their countryshould not betreated as children.Don't you tell mehow to run my army.General, the CanadianExpeditionary Forceis not your privatearmy, and I will notstand by while thelives of 30,000 menare compromised bysome vainglorious whim.Who the hell doyou think you are?Don't you dare talkto me like that!Do you know who I am?Do you realize theprime minister--your father was anothing, a nobody,and that's exactlywhere you'll end up if Ihave any say in the matter.Sir, the sun is aboutto set on your day to havea say in anything that matters.And as to your other point, my father didn't need to weara uniform to be a man of honor.Get off!Morning, Colonel.I knew it.Come over here.Come here, you.OK, don't-- don't--don't do this to me, bear.I don't-- we-- no, thisdoesn't work with--OK.OK.Oh, my goodness, you stink.I know exactlywhere you've been.Come on, let's go.Corporal, we needto have a chat.Did you sleep well?Hmm?Hmm?No problems last night?No, sir--Harry.Are you all right?Yeah, everything's fine.Just another day in--Gasoline, oil, and oxygen.It's highly combustible.That's what makesthe engine go.Yes, I know, but, uh, what I'mwondering is whether, uh, well,between here and where we'regoing, we-- we wouldn't bein harm's way at all, would we?Harry, are you positivethis is the only way?It's the only fencethat's not patrolled.Get down!Down!Down!That would be the reason why.Cease fire!You, there!That's no way totreat your weapon.Sir?This here Ross rifle's aterrible piece of junk.Heats up.Jams up all the time.Breech explodes.Can't shoot straight,even if I'm trying to-It's a poor workmanwho blames his tools!Yes, sir!All right, listenup, everybody.Get down!Now let me tell you the Rossrepeater is the most perfectmilitary rifle in the world.I helped modify it.This weapon is the mostaccurate weapon ever fired.Every single one of youshould be able to pinkhis enemy every time.Come on.Come on, let's go.Let's go.Harry, I must say Ifeel rather exposed.Here, take Winnie.Not to worry, withthis little beautwe will be thereand back in no time.There's not a lot of roomthere for me and the bear,is it?What's that?24-hour pass for both of us--What?--Signed by--Barret!Do-- do you have anyidea what just occurred?I think I do.All right, Winnie.It's time for youto do your business.Still have a fair ways to go.We don't want you to be doingyour business in the sidecaras there's not much room for abear's business in the sidecar.Harry, I've been, uh--Thinking?Indeed.About?Well, should anythingunfortunate occur,I would like my mother to, um--you see, she wasn't for this.It would be my honor.Thank you.But it won't come to that.Oh, no?Well, you haven't swallowedthat home by Christmas nonsense,have you?No.Then?Faith.That's funny.What?I wouldn't have taken youfor a man of the church.Faith in you.Henry, comelook and at this!He's a

past 20 years.Yes, they can be beguiling.They have a-- a knack ofamusing us and puttingus at our ease, so to speak.But believe me whenI tell you this,you can never loweryour guard, notfor an instant, not with bears.I don't think Winnieknows she's a bear.Yes, well, listen,I've got to lock up,so you, uh, sayyour final goodbyes.All right?Hey, we have to goaway for a while, Winnie.OK?No place for
