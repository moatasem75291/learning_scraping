            logo whooshingslow, dreamy musicspooky haunting music- Narrator OurMilky Way is just oneamong billions ofgalaxies in the universe.In every way, anordinary galaxy.It's 100,000 light years across.There are hundreds ofbillions of stars here.Almost lost insidethis huge swarmis one average sized star.As stars go, it'squite unremarkable.



Nevertheless, it'sthe most special placein all the cosmos.Orbiting this star isthe only place we knowin all the universeto harbor life.Our beautiful planetis a world of water,sparkling blue in thelight of our star.Two thirds of it is ocean.Gossamer clouds drift above it,driven by ocean currents.All of it is wrapped ina delicate cocoon of airthat shields us fromour star's radiation.Three brave explorersare about to leavethe safety of Earth.They are an American,Terry Virts,



a Russian, Anton Shkaplerov,and an Italian,Samantha Christoferetti.Their mission: six months inspace to study microgravity,do biomedical research,and observe the Earth.They're sealed insidethis tiny metal cocoon,a Russian Soyuzspacecraft travelingat 17,500 miles an hour.Their destination?The International Space Station.It was built in orbitby 16 countries.It's a research lab,training facility,and observatory,all powered by the sun.A truly awesome exampleof what we can achievewhen we work together.J‘ Someone knocking at the door J‘J‘ Somebody ringing the bell J‘J‘ Someone's knockingat the door J‘J‘ Someone's knockingat the door J‘J‘ Somebody's ringing the bell J‘I Do me a favor J‘- There they are.J‘ Open the door J‘- Butch Hey hey, you'rehung up in the cord.- Narrator Already on boardto welcome the new arrivals,Russian crew membersSasha Samokutaevand Yelena Serova.astronauts chattering faintly- Samantha The arrivalto the Space Stationwas possibly the happiestmoment of my life, really.And then they were,Yelena, Sasha, and Butchwelcome us on board and itwas just sheer happiness.We hugged, really I waslike a child at that point,I mean, it's something Ihad dreamed of for years,I'd studied the Space Station,I'd worked so hard to getthere and finally I was there.- Astronaut Come on man.- Astronaut I heardyou bagging all that.- Hi, Mom.- Narrator Terry is welcomedby Commander Butch Wilmore.- Terry Great launch.You know it was apretty wild ride.- Narrator Butchdescribes the crazy scene.- Butch As Iwatched Anton, I mean,he was thrilled and doing flips,and excited, floatingaround hitting the ceiling.shouting indiscerniblySamantha, the look on her face,just absolutely thrilling,it was literallyelectric in the room,it was fabulous.- Narrator Samantharecalls her first everview from space.- Samantha But I justcouldn't resist take a peekand I could just seethe Earth majesticallyflowing by and itwas like a river.And you know, I don'tknow what happiness is,but I was definitelyhappy at that time.- Narrator The cupellais a magical windowunlike any other on thespectacle of our Earthand ourselves, past,present and future.- Samantha What I alwaysfound especially movingwere the passes where wewould fly from the Atlanticand then fly over Gibraltaronto the Mediterraneanand it was almost likeI was doing this journeythat travelers from mythsand legends and the pasthad dreamt off or performedin the reverse wayright from the Mediterannean,through Gibraltar,which once was consideredthe end of the known world.- Narrator Morethan 500 years agoexplorers rounded thestormy tip of South Africa.As an omen for futuretrade, they named itthe Cape of Good Hope.At the same time, theglorious Caribbean beckonedwith the untold richesof the new world.Aboriginal people came fromAsia more than 30,000 years agobringing their spiritualties to this land,the continent we nowknow as Australia.The Mauri people from Polynesiatraveled thousands ofmiles in tiny canoesacross the Pacific Ocean beforethey reached New Zealand.Home to the ancientInca civilizationthe longest mountain rangein the world, The Andies.They stretch 45,000 milesacross some of the mostextreme climate zones on Earth,from ice fields to deserts.The oldest and driest desertis the Namib in Africa.You can see ourclimates from space,the great lakes of North Americalie trapped in ice and snowfor more than athird of the year.You can also see evidenceof Earths violent past.Asteroid impacts have leftscars on it's surface.This crater in Quebecis 62 miles across.The Earth is still active,volcanoes tearthrough it's surface,the Comchakka peninsular inRussia has over 100 of them.Now Terry Birdsdescribes his experience.- Terry One of themost beautiful thingsto see from space isthunder storms at night.And there's certainparts of the Earth,Central Africa especially,but also South East Asia,there are just amazingamounts of thunder storms.You see thousands offlashes per minute.Unbelieveable amount ofpower, when you think abouta giant lightning boltgoing off near your houseand how loud it is,and how that scares youand the dog runsunder the table,well when you see it fromspace there's so manyof these things happeningat the same time,it's truly amazing.- Male You see power, afunnel 25 miles in diameterof the center of ahurricane or a typhoonand you go oh my.- Terry TyphoonMysac was amazing,I've never seenanything like that,the eye was so big,so well defined.- Male That you realizethat that's energyand it power, powerful energy.- Narrator Far above thestorm, every drop of wateris carefully rationed.- Terry There'sno showers in space,so there's no, you can'tjust go under the waterand let it run, it'sjust kind of wet towelsand wiping down, butyou can get pretty cleanand washing yourhair is not too bed.- Female In principle wewant to recycle all the waterwhich means that theurine gets recycled,but also your sweat, allthe humidity from the airwhich is accuperatedinto the systemvia the air conditioningsystem also gets recycledinto portable water.It's not 100% efficient system,so we do have water bags onthe space station as well.- Narrator The Space Xresupply ship called Dragonarrives from Florida.It's one of the first commercialcraft to bring up supplies.- Male It brings foodand water and equipment,and without that wewouldn't be able to livemore then a few extramonths on the space station.But on Earth we kind ofdon't have any supply ships,it's almost likea mission to Marswhen you're not gonnaget a supply shipyou have to packeverything with you.- Male When we're alldoing cargo ops together,I mean it is organizedbedlam, literally,criss crossing, peopleflying, packages flying,going here and there,and you have to get themin the right place,you can't put itin the wrong spotbecause you'll lose it.You won't be able to find itbecause there's so much,literally thousands of itemsand you can't rememberwhere you put every singleone of them.That's why we have tohave this database.We lost a 14 inch torque wrenchand it was gone for five weeks,and just floated off I guess,and went into somelittle nook and crannysomewhere, hid itself, and itfinally reappeared one day.tranquil music- Woman I liketo sleep floating.So I did not attach my sleepingbag to the walls at all,and especially at thebeginning, I would just like,close my eyes andlet myself float,and just fall asleep.- Narrator Butch and Terryare getting readyfor a space walk.There are a lotof complex systemson the outside of the station,and sometimes, they need fixing.- Woman If you wannago outside of courseyou have to survivein outer space.This suit allows you to do that.So Butch reallyfills out the suit,but it also means when you'retrying to put the suit onor take it off, it'squite some work.- Butch Gettingout of the hatch isan entire operationin and of itself.We have so much equipment on us.Your backpack tends tobang into the hatch,or your helmet wantsto bang into the hatch.You walk around by grabbingonto things with your gloves,almost 300 degrees on the sunside of the space station.You get in the shade,it's minus 275 degrees.You feel that inside the suit.My fingertips in the sunlight,like, I could feelthem on fire almost,from the fatigue a littlebit but also from the heatcoming through on thatsun side of the orbit.So you know, I'd curlmy fingers at timesand put them in theshade a little bitand let them cool down.- Astronaut OkayButch, we'll take them.- Butch You can lose whereyou are on the station.So you're always thinkingyou have a safety tetherattached to the station.It's on a reel, like afishing reel type thingwith a spring thatalways reels it in.You can be upside down,twisted, inverted,and completely loseyour spatial awarenessabout where you are andwhat your attitude is,and you can easily get tangledup in that safety tetherif you're not cautious.Every single movement you make,you're making an effortto think through it.- Man The outsideof the space stationis not just a sidewalk.It's a jungle ofwires and equipmentand metal bars and tresses.Well, if you accidentallysliced your glove,or your space suit onone of those sharp edges,that could create a leak,and if that leak were bigenough, you would die.- Man The hardest thingduring a space walk, for me,is getting out of the hut.- Woman The only way thatwe found to actually getButch to come out of theupper torso of the hutwas for me to basically, pushand shake, and push and shake,until he finally was able tofree himself from the suit.groaninglaughing- There we go.christmas music- Man Holidays inspace were great,but to be honest, I missed home.Of course we didn't wannaleave Santa hanging.If there's somebody thatyou don't wanna make mad,it's Santa Clause,so we put the milk andcookies in the airlock.We weren't sure exactly howhe would get inthe space station,but we assumed theairlock would bekind of our equivalentof a chimney.So we thought thatwould be a good placeto leave the milk and cookies.laughing- Wow.- Hey!- Wow.- For you.- Nice.- For your haircut?- That is cool.- I think this isa secret messagethat I need to cut my hair.laughing- Man I speak three languages.I speak English,Russian, and Tennessee.As you're learning Russian,they say the first 10years is the hardest.That's a fact!And then all of a sudden,the day arrives, boom!And it's time to go home.- Narrator TheSoyuz spacecraft isready to take Butch,Sasha, and Yolana home.- Man And of course,you're looking forward,you're coming home,your wife, your family,you've been away fromthem for eight months.- Derek's man to man time,make us proud.- Man But of course,the people that you'releaving behind too,you spent six months with them,and it's a verymelancholy feeling,because the hatch shuts,and they're gone,and you realize that partof your life is over,and you're not gonnahave this same fellowshipwith those people ever again,and it is a sad feeling.- See you bud.upbeat pop musicJ‘ Baby break a sweat J‘J‘ Break a sweat J‘J‘ Baby break a sweat J‘J‘ Don't get tired yet J‘J‘ Tired yet J‘J‘ Don't get tired yet J‘- Man In space, withoutgravity pulling you down,you grow, and I grewalmost two inches.Unfortunately the minuteI got back to Earth,I lost those.- Narrator In zero G,without the loading of gravity,your bones and muscleswill weaken very quickly.To stay in shape isextremely importantfor the crews toexercise, a lot.J‘ Baby break a sweat J‘J‘ Break a sweat J‘J‘ Baby break a sweat J‘- Woman Well, we have twoand a half hours of exercisescheduled every day,and that includes cardio,and this marvelous machine,which is called ARID,and you can do things like,squats and dead lifts,and shoulder presses.- Man 80 this is a greatexample of no three being busy.I'm working on the bathroom,and there's a lot of plumbing,and valves, and systemsthat I was changing,all while Samantha's exercising.It's a busy place,but it's important to keepthis equipment working.J‘ Baby break a sweat J‘- Alright, Samantha.I'm gonna put thefinal clip in here.- Samantha I kept joking thathe wouldn't bequalified for his flightunless he came withme to my hair dresserto learn how to cut my hair.- Of all the thingswe do as astronauts,this scares me the most.- Narrator For the crewsthat live on the station,one of the mostimportant things of allis being able tosee, from day to daywhat we here on the groundcan't see so clearly.What is happening to our Earth,and how we are changing it.We began with a homeof lush, green forests,animals, and plants.With more and moreof us to feed,we began clearlythe land for farms,but when you cut down the trees,there are other losses too.Great forests once covered muchof the island of Madagascar.You can see how manyof them are gone.Without tree roots to anchor it,the red soil oozes downhill, clogging the rivers,and vanishing into the sea.Unique animals, like thelemurs are losing their homes.The great rainforest inBrazil continues to disappear.It's home to nearly halfthe species found on Earth.In just four decades,almost half amillion square mileshave been cut down and burned.From space you cansee huge smoke plumesstretching across the rainforestfor hundreds of miles.Thousands of species upin smoke, forever lost.As the forests burn,carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gassesspew into our atmosphere.We've always taken ourfresh air for granted,but we know now thatthe fossil fuels we burnalso release clouds of pollutioninto the air we breathe.They fill theatmosphere with gassesthat cause theclimate to change.As a result, the Earth'stemperature is rising.In California,it's affecting our most preciousresource on Earth, water.- Man Seeing Californiais beautiful from space.It actually looks like agiant ice cream scooperwent right down themiddle part of the stateand scooped outthe central valley,but it's very brown,and you could really tellthere's a drought going on,and that they couldprobably use a lot of rain.- Narrator In effortsto save parched cropswe used ground water.So much of it inthe last 75 years,that parts of the valleyhave sunk 30 feet.- Man The life ofranchers and farmersdepend on water rights,and who can take what waterout of which river.Even cities like San Diego,Las Angeles, and Phoenixdepend completely ontheir access to water.- Narrator TheColorado river basinsupplies water to 40 millionof us in seven states.The reservoirs thatmake the system workare losing waterat alarming rates.They need huge amounts ofrunoff from snow to feed them,and the runoff hasdwindled in recent years.California's reservoirscould soon be dry.- Man I had never seenthe Himalayas at all,and the immense size wasjust, it was mind boggling.They just went on for hundredsand hundreds of miles.- Narrator In theshadow of Mount Everest,several of the Earth's greatrivers begin their journeyacross the Indian subcontinent.They provide water todrink, irrigation for crops,a place for worship,but now the rising temperaturesare causing glaciers and snow,high on the plateau, to melt.The water supply ofover 500 million peopleis now threatened.By the time the river hasreached the Ganges Delta,they've become pipelinesfor all kinds of pollution,pouring into the sea,but problems likethis can be solved,and when we work at it,sometimes we succeed.- Man When I wasa kid in the 705,the Chesapeake Bay was a mess,and the fish, and thecrabs were disappearing,and there was a big restriction.You couldn't fish for rock fish,and other types of fish.It's been cleaned up,and in a few decades time,it's a beautiful place now.It's thriving.That's a great successstory of conservation.It's a giant universe out there,but there's nowhere like Earth.It's a beautiful planet.We have air that we can breathe,we have water that we can drink.Food is there for us.We have this life supportsystem that's like,perfectly designed tosupport billions of humansand it's pretty amazingto see how much effortwe had to put into designingand building the space station.- Narrator But whatif our surface waterdisappeared all together?This actually happened onour neighboring planet, Mars.Unlike Earth, Mars doesn'thave a magnetic field.Without any protection,its atmosphere was rippedaway from the planetby the solar wind.If you could stand on Mars todayyou would find a landscapeof lifeless desolation.Very cold and very dry.But on Earth things are goingin a very different direction.Ice and snow are melting atrates we've never seen before.In Greenland, time-lapse camerascaptured a 23 square mile chunkof the Yakov Slavinglacier breaking off.The Greenland icesheet is melting.If the whole icesheet were to meltsea levels could rise 20 feet.As the level rises, low lyingcoastal areas will submerge.The city of NewOrleans could be gone,but we could changethis if we step upto limit the greenhousegasses we're producing.- Samantha As human beingswe need to start to considerourselves more and more ascrew members of this Earth,not passenger, you know?Nobody gets a free ride.You have a responsibilityto take care of yourfellow crew mates.Just like we do onthe space station.It's more difficult to do itwhen you're talkingabout billions of people,but that's really the mindsetthat we have to work towards.crew chatteringand celebrating- Narrator A new crew hasarrived at the stations.Two Russians, Gennady Padalkaand Mikhail Korniyenko,and an American, Scott Kelly.The mission for bothScott and Mikhail,is to spend a full year hereso researchers can studyhow they're affectedby long-term space travel.Scott is soon providingdata for his study.- Woman One of themore recent discoveriesin terms of the effectsof weightlessnesson human physiologyis the effect thatit had on our eyes.Several long derationcrew members in the pasthave reported the worseningof their eyesight,while they were up in space.- Next one.That was what we needed Scott.Let's move on to the review.- I have an espresso, it'sa space espresso machine,which was developed in Italy,and we actually,for the first time,could enjoy a goodespresso in space.It's a welcomed change.I'm actually gonna tryand drink it out of thiszero G cup.Let's see what happens.Very much an experiment,but it will be a lot nicerif I get to drink my espressofrom an actual cup,instead of from a pouch.Let's see.smooth easygoing musicWow, that was good.That was real good.- Narrator Sixmonths have passed,and it's time for Terry,Samantha, and Antonto say their goodbyes.It's a bittersweet departure.- See you on Earth.- Narrator Three newcrew members have moved in.They've set abouta special project,which will be very importantwhen people take longerjourneys to other planets.The best results areproduced in this pink light.Without soil, thecrew is attemptingto grow their own crops.Kjell Lindgren, anAmerican medical doctor,inspects the progress.- Kjell Vege was anamazing experiment,to grow this plant in spacebut we also got to eat it.- Narrator Kjell's crewmate,Kimiya Yui, is from Japan.- Kjell Well I know thatI enjoyed the lettuce.I think Kimiya is not abig fan of vegetables.His father is actuallya lettuce farmer.So I think he's hada lot of lettuce.- Narrator Happily, freshfood is about to arrive,this time on the JapaneseHTV resupply ship.- Man The HTVmaneuver is complete.- Kimiya It's likea golden treasure box.- Kjell A golden treasure box?laughingYou'll have to share yourbeef teriyaki bowl with me.reggae musicJ‘ Brother bought a coconut,he bought it for a dime J‘J‘ His sister had another oneshe paid it for the lime J‘J‘ She put the lime in thecoconut, she drank 'em bot' up J‘J‘ She put the lime in thecoconut, she drank 'em bot' up J‘J‘ She put the lime in thecoconut, she drank 'em bot' up J‘J‘ She put the limein

I said doctor, torelieve this belly ache J‘- Narrator We areapproaching England,and its great capital, London.Across the English Channelto right is France,and the Glorious city of Paris.Europe lies beyond.- Man During the daytime,it's kind of hard to tellthat people are on Earth.You don't see that muchevidence of humanity.- Narrator But at night,the same view tellsa different story.It's easy to see how populatedour planet really is,and how many of us havegathered in towns and cities.Now you can spot famous citieslike Amsterdam, Brussels,the capital of Russia, Moscow,the vibrant cities of Japan,Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo,Beloved Rome, and Naples.- Woman Italy atnight is very modernbecause it's incredibly bright.It's a densely populatedcountry of course,so you really seeall the cities,and you have thisvery distinct shapethat you can very definitelysee at night as well,of this boot,reaching into the darknessof the Mediterranean.It is justoverwhelmingly beautiful.- Narrator The undulatingribbon of light is Nile River,illuminated by people drawnfrom the desert to its water.Cairo gleams like a jewelin the Delta's crown.To the left, Israel,and the cities of TelAviv and Jerusalem.- Man I think one ofthe most amazing sightsI saw with my eyewas coming across the southernUnited States, Florida,into the Caribbean sea,through the Bahamas at night,with a full moon,and you could see the aquacolors in the Bahama area,all the way down through Cuba,and then the DominicanRepublic, Haiti,on into Puerto Rico,and then the VirginIslands beyond that.Oh my goodness.- Man Fishing boatsreally stand out at night,especially in Asia,and the Animen Sea,and near Thailand, there's abunch of green fishing boats.During the day you can't tellthere's people in the oceandown there, but at night time,there's lots of folks fishing.You can see that.- Man I can seewhere I was born,Murphy's Burrow looks like alittle diamond below Nashville.North of that, Louisville,of course Indianapolisjust beyond there.Pittsburgh, and thenlooking to the leftyou can see the great lakes,and of course the citiesof Green Bay, Chicago,you can see Clevelandevident, Buffalo,and then furtherup the east coast,coming to Richmond, Washington,Baltimore, Philadelphia,New York, LongIsland sticks out,just absolutely gorgeous.Boston, Cape Cod, very visible,just absolutely beautiful,and then of course thecities across the border,Toronto, Ottawa,Montreal, Quebec City.- Narrator Astronautsoften remark thatyou don't see any nationalborders from space,but there are exceptions.The strand of orangelight dividing the viewis the border separatingPakistan from India.- Man I wish that thereweren't issues, but there are.We have different ideals,and different mindsets,and it causes usto have the border.- Narrator The mostnoticeable border at nightis between Northand South Korea.- Man Seoul, South Koreais one of the brightest,most vibrant citieson the planet.The whole South Koreancountry is lit up,and then there's thisline in the border,and this completedarkness of North Korea,with a few little whitelights where Pyongyang is,but there's a similarnumber of peopleon both sides of the border,and you can reallysee the differencebetween how people live.- Narrator By moonlight,the Gulf of Mexicoand the great cities of Dallas,Houston, and San Antonio.The landscape aroundthem is ablazewith thousands ofoil and gas flares.To meet our ever-increasingenergy needs for the future,we'll have to developnew energy sourceson a far larger scale,and one of them is our own sun.As the space stationcrosses its face,from 250 miles below,you can see the solar panelsthat provide its power.Here on Earth, we must gobeyond capturing the sun's raysand learn how to createenergy the way the sun does,by nuclear fusion.The challenge is tobuild a fusion reactorthat will provide enoughpower for all our needs.If you can figure outhow to reproduce thisyou can create immenseamounts of powerand leave no pollution.Our sun also bombards uswith lethal radiation.Without protection, most livingcreatures cannot survive it,but our Earth hasa magnetic fieldwhich deflects the harmfulparticles away from us.The aurora shows thatshield in action.mystical captivating musicBecause we have this magicalmagnetic field protecting us,we have our forests,oceans, animals, and people.It's why ours isa planet of life.bagpipe musicbagpipe musicmystical captivating music- Woman What struck melooking at Earth from spaceis the fact that you canreally perceive it visuallyas a spacecraft.I've heard before aboutyou know, spaceship Earth,but when you are up there,you really cannotescape that notion.It's totally obvious thatit is a celestial bodythat is carrying all of us,all of humanity,all of life on Earth onthis journey through space,and just like the spacestation is, you know,a human made outpost therethat allows us to survivein this hostileenvironment of space,well, you know, our Earthdoes the same for all of us.I can imagine of coursea future in whichhuman beings are able totravel to other star systems.So I really hopethat at some pointthere will be a breakthroughin science and technologythat will allow us totravel faster than lightand actually exploredifferent star systems.- Narrator Don'tyou wonder sometimes?Are there planetsaround other stars?Could they have life?Though, we can't yet travelto the stars ourselves,our telescopes can.Astronomers havealready discoveredseveral thousand planets.We're searching around starsfor the perfect conditions,not too hot, not too cold,for liquid water to exist.We call this theGoldilocks zone.We can detect a planet as itcrosses in front of a star,blocking its light.This is one systemwe found, Kepler 186.It's 500 light years from Earth,and it contains a remarkablefive Earth sized planets.Most important of all, theoutermost planet, Kepler 186Fis just the right distancefrom its star for water,and life to exist.Could this be another Earth?- Woman In the end,it's about two things.It's about this greatadventure of exploring,and then it's abouthow our world works,and expanding the possibilitiesof what we human beings can do.- Narrator And we cando great things together.If we all do our part,for our children,and great grandchildren,our Earth will always bea beautiful planet.upbeat musicJ‘ Hello world J‘J‘ It's nice to
