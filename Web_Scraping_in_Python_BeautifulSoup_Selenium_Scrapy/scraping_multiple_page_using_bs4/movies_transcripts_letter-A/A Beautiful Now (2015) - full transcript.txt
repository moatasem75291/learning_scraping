Rom, babes?I don'twant to be alone.Just until it's light again.OK?Yeah, we'll stay.OK?We'll stay as long as you need.Why do I love dance?Because, to me,life is movement.In real life you knowyour eyes are gluedto the ground in front of you.But when you dance,you have to look up.You can't think anymore.Your body takesover, transforms you.And it only existsfor the secondthat it's insideyour body and then itlives forever in your memory.Lets us know that we'reall a part of eternity.I guess I just don't reallylike reality that much.I mean I don't know whoin their right mind does.You know so whenI'm dancing I canpretend that it doesn't exist.And every time that I think thatI've closed the door on realityit comes in through the window.Didn't you ever wishfor something more?Are you having panic fitella?No, I'm so freaking dizzy.What is this?You know I think it's nice thistradition you having birthdayjust the two of you.Yeah, I know.Can you believe we've done thisevery year for the last eightyears?Let me get this straight.So you just add ortake one tiny letterand it changes everything?Yeah, like hepatitisbecomes hipatitis, whichdescribes terminal coolness.Yes.Forploy is when someonemisrepresents themselvesin order to get laid.The scarecrow.Um, Sarchasm is a gulf betweenan author's sarcastic witand the person thatdoesn't quite get it.I don't get it.I know, but you will.With your help.With my help.So the real reason we're here.Tavalodet moba...Tavalodet mobarak.TavalodetTavalodet.Mobarak.Tavalodet mobarak.One year before year2010th birthday.You know Rage folded?Mm hm.And the world is missing yetanother angry undergroundmagazine where the editoris passionately decryingthe injustices of our society.I think the worldis missing it.Well, I don't.What's up with you, Ella?I don't know.I think it's the stress.I'm just totally nauseous.Just a sec.It's bad reason but it'snice to be all together again.Yeah, I know what you mean.How are things with Dad?You know how's working with him?He's fine.It's fine.It's called growing up.Used to call that giving up.I don't care.Hey, if you're happyI'm all for it.I'm just surprised.Is Terrence dead yet?Well, he probably isn'tgiven that with the moneyyou've shuffled in basedon your warped geneticshe could afford thebest shit while you guyswere exploring your dark side.Terrence died nine months ago.Before I went to rehab.I've been trying to tell you.I finally did it.I did it.I guess for his big.So we had the memorial.It was time.OK.OK.Hey, Romy, can wetalk about Steve?Yes, I'd like toknow what happened.I wanted him to love me.I needed him to love me.I would have doneanything for that.Did you love him?No, but that wasn't the point.Welcome to theinauguration of the ParkerStreet bitch club.Hi, Jessica, how was Washington?Steve, this is Ella.Ella, Steve.He just shot our"issues" issue cover.Hm.You know what I realizedwhen you were gone?I was so miserable it wasalmost like you were still here.Isn't

exploding.More and more peopleneed affordable housing.And they're added on to peoplewho are escaping violent homesand to the mentally ill,who are being dumped.I mean these peoplethey're desperate.Yes, I'm stillliving with Romy.It's very nice.She no kick outafter losing home.Of course not.You can stay with me aslong as you like, gorgeous.OK.So tomorrow we're goingto march on city hallduring their meeting to proveeven more unaffordable condosin development.I have leaflets in my car.Get some before you leave.This concludes my bitch, Thankyou very much for listening.And to go alongwith your

I wanted.He knew who I really am.With that fuck, not someAristotelian proposition.You don't have tothink about it.You just do it.Move, I got it.OK, Romy, you caneither ask me to help meor you can tell me how youwant it done, not both.You can help me organize shit.You know every time youcome home put your keysin the same fucking spot.Every fucking time.So you wouldn't spend 10minutes every single morningrunning around thehouse looking for shit.You know?I mean just put things in thesame spot every single timeand then you'd neverlook for anything again.Establish a routineand stick to it.Is it so hard?Is it so fuckinghard to do that,to have some follow through?My god, you're stupid.I mean just throw shitout that you don't use.Your never goingto need it again.It's not fucking brain surgery.Come on, this isn't aboutme looking for my keysevery morning.You hate me, don't you?Why do you hate me so much?Because you love me.There must be somethingso wrong with you.We always thought youguys were so happy.I don't think she has anyclue what that really mean.Why are you so angry with her?I'm not.But I was because shetook you away from me.No, because... because Iknew she would hurt you.Just like a record lady.Just like a record lady.Just like a record lady.Just like a record lady.Just like a record lady.Just like a record lady.I told youI didn't love youand you said youwere OK with that.I lied.What do you want from me, Romy?I don't know.A little while ago I wouldhave said a beautiful now.And some time of full ofexcitement and passionand life.But right this second,I'd settle for some sugar.Could you get itfor me from the bar?What the fuck doyou want from me?What do you want from me?When did life stopbeing beautiful.No, no, no, no, no.You see that's the problem.You never understood.There's more thanjust beautiful.Life just isn't likethat, Romy, thereare long, fast, stretcheswhich are just boring.And that's normal.Why didn't you doanything about it?Because I didn't care.And you shouldn't either.I was just so sick ofyou moaning about LA winters.You know it's justnot the same, Romy.So I don't know.Marry me.What?Marry me.Does it ever turn outlike we expect it to?I though you gotwhat you wanted.No.I didn't.Steve said I'm theonly one he ever loved.Steve?When you were workingtogether on our shoots?How do I not know this?You were too busychanging worlds.I was busy makingmodels look pretty.And Steve was busy doing models.And then he tell mehe want to be buddies.And I tell him, no,it's not how it work.I suck your dickyou're not my buddy.Oh, my god.Now I'm in love with you too.I think that is the most wordsI've ever heard you say, Jaki.Oh, and here's more.You walk away frommagazine like it's nothing.Whoa, OK.I think I kind ofpreferred the less words.Jaki, I didn't haveanything to say anymore.You know there was nothingthat I was passionate about.I think I was depressed.This is anger,with no enthusiasm.You want... how you say this?Bypass of heart.Bypass heart.In my country youdo not give up.Do you understand?You cannot be touristin your own life.She doesn'tunderstand it either.Exactly.Hey.Hey.Sushi.Sushi.Uh, hi.Hi.I know I should havecalled you, but, uh,you know on the other hand...You have the wrong fingers.Yes.Uh, so you're getting married.Yes.Congratulations.Thank you.Is it someone that you know?Funny.Yeah.Very funny.It's super funny.We met a few months ago.Her name is Molly.Of course it is.What's that supposed to mean?Nothing.She's safe.You know it's easy, it's simple.She worships me.She doesn't know you.That's true, but Idon't want her to.It's easier that way.Four most infuriatingwords... I should have known.I wonder how you can getover it one more time.Believe it one more time.Keep going one more time.You have to keep going.You have no choice.I learned that growing up.Oh, that's rich comingfrom a girl who grew upon the mean streets of Hawaii.Alohahi, la, la, la, la.Hey, asshole, Igrew up in Detroit.My mom only moved usto Hawaii after my dadleft the five of usto fend for ourselvesduring the worst winter ever.I think she figured that ifshe had worked three jobsto support four little girlsthat maybe she should do itin a better climate.Is that OK with you?OK but does thatexplain why youcan't say one sentence withoutthe word I or me in it?I don't.Enough!Enough!Enough!Newsflash, it is not about you.If I was her I would be outhere threatening to shootthe both of you.I mean I love you guys butit's been what... seven yearsof us hanging out?And the entire timeI kept wonderingwhat's wrong with you.No, let me rephrase that.I kept wonderingwhat self-inflictedpsychological drama thatyou're going through this time.Has it ever occurredto either one of youthat, contrary topopular belief,the world does notrevolve around you?You could've justtold me to shut up.I did.You totally go down.OK, this is now officiallyone of the few momentswhen I miss taking drugs.They made me feelgood for no reason.I mean before theymade me feel worse.I'm just being honest.OK?How clear are youon the concept, J?Honest like when you stolemom's bracelet and pawned it?Aaron, I tried to get itback but it was already gone.Did you know that Dadripped the house apartbecause he wanted to find it sohe could give it to you to makeyou feel better after Mom died.It is the only thingthat he has left overand he wanted to give it to you.He still can't see what hislittle golden princessesis capable of.Golden princess?Yes, J, in hiseyes you are stillhis gorgeous littleperfect girl.The pretty one, made peoplestop on the street in awe.What a talent that is.God, you are such a cheap date.No wonder even my shybrother could pick you up.Hey, are you listeningto me at all?Hm?So check it out.First I thought, I shouldwrite a travel book.You know because I'm a model.But then I realized ithad to be a cook book.You know I love cooking.You know I do, right?What?Yeah.But you're a model.What would your recipe be like?It would be like stick twofingers down your throatand spew up everythingthat you've evereaten in your entire life.And then chop uplittle bits of speedand put them inlittle nice piles.And then sort them.And then wash them downwith more champagne.Ha ha.No, seriously, would that be it?Fuck you.It's amazing howquickly you cango from fuck you to fuck me.Hello?Hello?Put down, Romy.It's plastic.This place isn't that nice.You know what they say, whenyou run out of champagneyou gotta order more cocktail.Oh, look, you have champagne.Romy, put that down.Why?Put it down oryou're going to startfrench kissing the bar again.I'd rather kiss you.That's not funny.Why is that not funny?Come here.What are you doing?I'm going to give you a kiss.Fuck me.I stared out stainedglass windowsbut I didn't see anything.I lived just like a shadow.I didn't feel anything.If there's a god inheaven, won't youtell him to let me in.I promise I'll be a good girl.I promise I won't give in.And you tell me, baby, I knowthat love can get so hard.Look out that window.You could bedancing in the yard.And I know it's crazy, butwe've got to find a spark.Keep on burning and we'llbe dancing in the dark.What's wrong?I'm Sorry, I can't do this.Oh, fuck you.You say that god's in heaven.He wants to let me in.I'll promise I'llbe a good girl.I'll promise I wont give in.You tell me, baby, I knowthat life can get so hard.From fuck you to fuck me.We're back again.What were you thinking, J?I know I screwed upon so many levels.I'm sure I don'tdeserve a second chance.I'm not sureyou do either.It's funny howalike you two are.Me and Ella?You and Romy.It's really why youdidn't trust her.I'm sorry, Aaron.I'm so sorry.Hello?And mothers and fathers.Yes.Fathers and mothers.And fathers and daughters.You will have sucha good time, my dear.Romy June, they will love you.Look at them.I'm nervous.Oh, you have nothingto be nervous about.All of these people have beendoing this a really long time.I just started, Dad.I'm not going to be that good.How could they not love you?That's it, go.I will be here whenyou come out, OK?Promise?Promise, I will be right here.I won't go anywhere.OK.Love you.Love you too, June.That's where Ifell in love with dance.It never

understand.Thank you for calling.Maybe it's ironicthat mama call me Mimi,like mi, mi, mi.But then she forgotto pick me upat grandparents'house for 15 years.Yeah, kind of.Or is it ironicthat for a monthshe call every daysaying she wantto come to Americafor first fashion showbecause she is alonely and broke.And then, forgetto get on plane Ipay for because shehas new boyfriend.Elle, what would you say?Screw you.What she is trying toexpress so eloquently,Jaki, is that a lotof women do that.They try so hard to bein a new relationshipthat they forget the onesthat they're already in.And then theyforget themselves.They give away their freedom.What's going on, Elle?What's wrong.There's nothing wrongwith being married.And there is nothing wrongwith living in Newport Beach.And there's
