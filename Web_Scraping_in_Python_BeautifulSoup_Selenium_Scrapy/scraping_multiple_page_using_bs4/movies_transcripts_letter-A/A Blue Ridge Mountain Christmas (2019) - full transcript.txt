I'm Willow petersen.- Oh...- I...Actually grew up here.Petersen.Was your father hank?You guys usedto own this place, right?Yes, my father built the place.And my sister, Juni...Juni is getting marriedto austin,who is my best friend.You're Juni's sister, Willow.Okay.It's all coming together now.I get it. Um...I just gotta say,your family dida fantastic job of this place.Thank you, really.It was a great placefor a kid to grow up.Yes. Yes, indeed, indeed.Sorry, you were sayingyou wanted to do somethingto my barn?Yes, so, speakingof Juni and austin,you heard that they losttheir wedding venue.- Right?- Yes.So I was just thinking thatthey could get married here,at eagle ridge.Right. Yeah, no, actually,we've had that conversation,but unfortunately,there's nowhereto have the ceremony, so.Oh, but there is.The barn?Yeah. I mean, look at this...There's enough space.With the right decor,it would be absolutely gorgeous.I guess you haven't heardI'm actually selling the inn.I did, but it's not sold yet.No, but we do havea prospective buyerwho's on the fence right now,but it's looking pretty good.But maybe he could justwait a couple weeksuntil after Christmas.It's only a few weeks away.Right. Four weeks to organizean entire wedding,get all the stuff, and plus,the inn needs some work.Which I would oversee, bec...Did you know, I actually,I work in hospitality,and I do a lot of eventsfor my company's hotels.And, when you think about it,hosting a wedding herewould be kind of likestaging it for your sale.- Huh.- Mm.The buyerwas asking about weddings.Right? We can show himthe possibilities.- We?- Yes! Well, me.I would do all of the work.You wouldn'thave to do anything.It's just the cost and the...No, my family's payingfor everythingthat has to do with the wedding.Look, I would absolutelylove to help,I mean, I'm austin's best man,but I just, I don't really haveany time for this right now.I'm very busy,and I gotta go to workright now.Sure, but maybe...- It was so nice...- But...To meet you, Willow.You too! Or we could talk...[sighs][words catch][shouts] do you like cookies?Is this too low?Who wants to get marriedin a barn?I mean, it's a barn.Yeah, this is too low.Someone's gonna run into thisand sue me...It was just so out of the blue,you know?Which would be ironic.Hey. You listening to me?What?I said... Whoa, that's too low.Well, can you help me out then?No, I can't,because I am gonna godazzle the partnerswith my brilliant legal mind.Well, how are you gonna do that?Mm, I guess, I'll say"ergo" and "to wit" a lot,'cause they love that stuff.Shockingyou haven't made partner yet.- Mm.- Hey, hey.- Ask about secret santa.- What about it?I sent in a proposalto up the maximum gift priceto 30 bucks.Right. How much wasthat portable putting greenyou wanted for your office?Um, $29.99.- Exactly.- It's a coincidence.Okay.Listen.You know that I wouldhost the ceremonyif I thoughtI could make it work, right?Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.Don't worry about it.- Okay.- We'll figure it out.- We will, right?- Yeah, yeah.- Okay.- All right.[sighs] it is too low.We are gonna needa lot more jellybeans.You have enough for that.This is only the beginning.This is the guest house, hon!Oh, I see.The coffee shop down the streethas a gingerbread houseand yours has to bethat much bigger and better?I'm simply showingthat brogan's dineris the place to befor the true spiritof Christmas.[laughs]Jun, you're kind of quiet.I'm just thinking abouthow special it would beto get married at eagle ridge.[sighs] I'm sorry.I shouldn't haveeven said anything.You know, I tried.He just wouldn't evenconsider it.Give the guy a break.You know, it must be...It must be tough for him.What, selling the inn?Needing to sell the innbecause you can't do itby yourself anymore.Not ever intending to do itby yourself in the first place.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.I didn't think about itthat way.How did you do it, mom?You went right from the innto the restaurant,and you raised two kidswhile doing it.Well... [chuckles]You know what?It's like a house.You have a solid foundation,you can make itwhatever you want.Your dad and I made...A pretty solid foundation.[♪♪♪]Mwah... Mwah.- I love you.- I love you.[♪♪♪]Hey, sweetie.Henry wasn'tin the kitchen either.But dad...I know, I know,but we've looked everywhere.He's gonna turn up eventually,I promise.In the meantime,you've got allyour stuffed animals right here.But henry's my favorite.Mom gave him to me.I know.And since this is our lastChristmas at the inn,I'll need henry more than ever.Right. So, we're gonna keeplooking for him tomorrow,and we'll find him, I promise.I still don't understandwhy we have to move.[sighing softly]Well... It's like I've said.My job's about to becomea lot bigger,and I'm not gonna have as muchtime to devote to the inn.But grandma helps.And garrett, too.And I can do more.Hey.Remember last year,when we donated someof your toys to the church?Yeah, they were onesI didn't have timeto play with anymore.Right.But there are kids out therethat do have timeto play with toys,and toys do need someoneto play with them, right?Right.Well, that's kind oflike the inn.You know? It needs someoneto pay attention to itin ways that I can't anymore.Someone who can...Love it, care for it,like we have.That's a lot of love.That is a lot of love.I'm gonna miss it here.Yeah. Me too.[chuckles softly]Hey. Get some sleep.[laughs]Goodnight, dad.Goodnight, sweetie.Mwah! All right.[♪♪♪][laughing]Well, thanks for picking upthe tab for lunch, dad.Oh, happy to.You take us out all the time.- Willow.- Willow?Hi.Yeah, hey.- Hello.- Hey.Uh, mom, dad,this is Juni's sister.- You're Willow!- Yes.Linda talks about youall the time at the diner.Oh, I'm sorry.Oh, don't be silly.Being proud of our kidsis part of our job.Like this one is aboutto become partnerat his law firm.Yes, I heard. Congratulations.Thank you, but, again,I'm not partner yet,and it's definitelynot gonna happenif I take lunches this long,so I should get back to work.But it was greatto see you, Willow.Actually, would you mind ifI walked with you a little ways?No.Great. Nice to meet you.See you, guys.- You too, Willow.- Bye now.So, uh...About the wedding.I do think that putting onone big eventbefore you leavecould help you sell it, though.I mean, really,Christmas used to be spectacularat eagle ridge.We would go all outwith lights and decorations.We used to have carriage rides.Wow. Carriage rides?Yes, you know, like a hay ride,but without the snow.It was the closest thingthat people could getto a sleigh ride.They used to love it.What I mean is,don't you want one lastspectacular Christmas there,before you leave?I mean,I know that natalie would,but I just, I gotta tell you,I just don't have the timeto do anything.Oh, I-I would do everything.Everything.I would do Christmas,I would do the wedding.I could even bring in a teamto do any repairsthat you could need.I've actually gota repairman, garrett,he could actuallytake care of all that.Why is this so important to you?My family built eagle ridge.It's Juni's big day.It's just very important to us.I wouldn't have to do anything?I would do absolutelyall of the work.You wouldn't evenknow that we are there.And david...You would be making a lot ofChristmas wishes come true.I don't want to go too crazy.Is that a yes?To Christmas wishes...To Christmas wishes.[♪♪♪]Okay, now, since the receptionwill be spilling outinto this room,I think it needs some attention.What are you thinking?Well, the floors could usea good polishand I think we needa new coat of paint.Sorry. You're... Painting?Of course.Oh. I just kind of thoughtyou were tidying up.I mean, this room doesn't evenneed to be painted, does it?We're just sprucing it upa little bit.I'd keep it simple, I promise.Let me show you some swatches.Oh, you know what,I just came home for lunch.Five minutes, I promise.Stop encouraging her.- So...- Okay.Oh, hi!I was hoping I was gonna runinto you before I left.I literallyjust walked in the door.Oh, but I need to talk to youabout something important.Christmas decorations.I think we have plenty already.Do we need more?I think we need to talk aboutadding more lights.How many more?Well, probably a strand or two.Five at the most.We also need to re-openthe discussion about paint.Paint? But I...So, here's what I'm thinking.We put the altar down here.Okay, no, that's great.Austin and I will be therein 30 minutes, max.45 minutes, max.Okay, can you just go aheadand read it to me?So do you really thinkyou can make this placelook good in time?Oh, yeah, I mean,it's mainly cosmetic.It'll be a snap.Great. So you won't mindif we add a few things?Oh, like what?The wedding's two daysbefore Christmas,so we want trees.Trees, plural?Yes. Like,eight or nine of them.Yeah, and lots of decorations.Yes, and garlandsand wreaths and bows,the whole nine yards.Wait, I... Hold on one sec?I... [stammers]One tree is plenty. Did...[footsteps][dejected sigh]Hi.

It's... A lot sometimes.I was actually the exact sameway when I was little.Everything had to beturned up to 11,especially at Christmas.So, not a lot has changed?Look, I thought we agreed,I just want to put ona beautiful weddingand have an excellent Christmas.And I thought we agreedthat that's what was bestfor everybody.Right, no, I was just wonderingwhen we're gonna get to the partwhere I don't haveto worry about anything?Tomorrow. Friday at the latest.I'm serious, Willow.I can't keep gettingpulled away from workto give your sisterher dream wedding...Which apparently involvesevery Christmas treein existence, for some reason.It's not just about the wedding.It's about getting your buyeroff the fenceand putting ona spectacular eventthat shows offwhat a magical placeeagle ridge really is.I hear you,and I appreciate that,I really do,but the reasonI'm selling the innis because I need to focus onbecoming partner,and that has to come first.Look, all I'm saying isyou said you were gonnatake care of everything,and that hasn't been the case.You know what? You're right.As of right now,you're off the hook.Thank you.- Dad!- Hey.Come on, I need to show youall the trees I picked out.Tomorrow. Friday at the latest.Sure. No, the payroll companydoes all that.Yeah, you just have to approvethe time sheets.Thanks, tasha. Bye.- I'm sorry...- [robert gasps] oh!- [robert laughing]- I'm so sorry!I just didn'twant to get in your picture.Sorry, I was just daydreaming,I guess.That's okay.I just hope it was a good dream.It might be.In fact, I was just imaginingwhat this placemight look like withmore Christmas decorations.I'm thinkingabout buying the place.Oh!Please, allow me. Picture this.Sparking lights...On the roof, around the windows,the eaves,garlands with bows,of course, every five feet.More wreaths,and here, on the rocks,light-up snowmen.[laughs] you've reallythought this out.I actually grew up here.My familyused to own eagle ridge.Really?Yeah.What was it likegrowing up here?I was just so lucky. You know?Anyway, do you have children?Two daughters,but they're grown.Grand kids or...?Mm. Not yet.Right, well, when you do,they're gonna love it here.Hmm.I wish I could'veseen this placethe way it used to be.Anyway, I'm so sorryfor being in the way.Not at all. Stop, you're not.- Robert.- Willow.- Nice to meet you.- And you.[both] take care.[♪♪♪]All right, so you got the filefor the harrison merger?Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.[grumbles] aw.What? What's wrong?Willow needs meat the inn, again.Okay, well,don't worry about it.I can cover this.- You sure?- Yeah, I'm good. Go.All right. Thank you.Go get 'em.So, everything's on track?Yes, it is.Okay, because you do knowthat Christmas and the weddingare in three weeks.Three and a half, more or less.Okay, at the hotel,where I work with spreadsheets,there's no such thingas "more or less"in a spreadsheet, so...Well, before I worked here,I was a contractor,and we specializein "more or less."okay. Don't worry.Everything will get done.It's like Christmas.You just gotta believe.Willow, what's up?I got your text.- Hey. Okay.- Hey.Tell me what you see.Is this a trick question?No. Just look at the innand tell me...Willow, I don't havetime for this.Okay, fine,I will tell you what I see.Okay.We need more Christmas.I think we haveplenty of Christmas.Nope. Not accordingto your prospective buyer,robert?I ran into him, right here,and he was just sayingthat he wisheshe could see the inn done up,full Christmas spectacular.And you thinkthat'll convince him to buy it?I think that he needsa reason to believethat the inn is special,and he justhasn't found one yet.But, I mean, lights and garlandare temporary.He can do whatever he wantswith the inn when he owns it.Look, for whatever reason,he's havinga hard time picturing it.He needs to see it,not just hear about it.Okay. What do you have in mind?Okay.I didn't realizehow much I missed it here.So you don't evercome home for Christmas?I just usually only geta day or two off.Between family and friends,I haven't been making it down.[sighing] I just love it.Do you like it?It's really nice.It is a little bit sad, though,that you have to sell the innin order to be partner.Well, I've beenworking toward itsince law school.It's actually nice to finallyget back on track.How so?I had a plan.You know?Law school, pass the bar,get married, have a kid,and make partner.But, sadly, things got derailedwhen my wife dieda few years ago.Right. I'm sorry.What was her name?Shelly.The inn was really her passion.I mean, don't get me wrong,natalie and Ilove it there, too,but it's just...Time to move on.How did you deal with it whenyou guys had to sell the inn?Not very well.I was 15.It was right aftermy dad passed and...Yeah, finding outwe needed to sell eagle ridgeit was...It was another huge loss.I'm sorry, too.I think it's part of whyI do what I do,that I wanted to bein the hotel industry.I wanted to recapture some ofwhat I experienced as a kid,you know,share that with people.Have you?I try...But it's different.Yeah.I get transferred around a lot,I never truly feelsettled anywhere.But I think that maybe whenI'm managing my own property,it'll be different,it'll feelmore fulfilling somehow.Ah, someday, right?Why not today?'Cause today is scary.Hey.What about that wreath there,for the barn door?We'll take it.Oh, I got it.That's the spirit!It's so cold out.Wow!Put on your gloves.It's freezing.Wow![all chuckling]Well, what do you think?I love it.But I think we needto give the snowmen names.I think so, too.Did you have anything in mind?Hmm...Prancer, comet,donner, and blitzen.Those are reindeer names.They can be snowmen names, too.That's a good point.Don't they light up?Yes, they do.We are just waiting for garrettto put the finishing toucheson the lights,then we'll turn 'em on.Is this what Christmas was likewhen you were a kidhere, Willow?Why, yes, it was actuallya lot like this.The whole family wouldget together and decorate.We'd sing Christmas carols,we'd drink hot chocolate.It was... Mm.Hot cocoa. I've got some made.Oh!Good. Let's go get it.Do you miss it?Having Christmas at the inn?Well, yes, sometimes,but, you know, I also, um,kind of miss it in a good way.You know?My dad always used to saythat memories are the thingsthat we useto wrap ourselves up into keep us warm at night.And it's true.Even today,no matter where I am...I always feel warmthinking about allthe special nights I spent here.Just like this one?Well, yeah, just like this one.[♪♪♪]Hot chocolate.Oh.Oh, great!Okay. I think we're ready.Now, I patched everythinginto a remote control,so all you have to dois hit the button.Oh, great. Thanks, garrett.All right.Natalie, want to do the honors?Ooh. Yes, please.Ready? This button here.Three... Two... One.[♪♪♪]- [all gushing]- beautiful!Wow!Okay, wait, wait, wait.There's more, there's more.Turn around. Ready? And...Now.[♪♪♪][overlapping] oh!Now, that'swhat I call Christmas.[♪♪♪]It's looking pretty goodin here.Yeah. I mean,there's still a lot to do,but I think we've maderemarkable progress in a week.How many trees did you get?Santa's villageis gonna be jealous.Hey, can you switch outthose electrical outletsI showed you?- Yeah. Sure.- Great.Do you want to write it down?I got it.Garrett, we have a lot to doand not a lot of time to do it.Three weeks. More or less.Right. I...[muttering] henry...?Where are you, henry?Oh.

I haven't thought of itthat way.[sighs] okay.Now I really wantto bake Christmas cookies.Me too![deep breath] hmm.So, tell me, what elseabout Christmasdo you thinkis worth waiting for?Hmm... Everything.[laughs]We have dinner at my grandma's,and then we callmy other grandparents,my grandma and grandpa,on the computer,and we always haveChristmas morning at the inn.I mean...

[Laughs]First thing Monday,I'm gonna havemy realtor call yours.We're gonna make you an offer.That's terrific!I-I...I don't even know what to say.Well, you can startby saying whereyou got that Christmas cookie.It smells delicious.They're in the kitchen.You go help yourself.I'll be right there. I'm...Oh, wait! Hey!Let's just keep this newsbetween you and I for now,until it's a done deal, okay?No problem.- Terrific!- All right.[♪♪♪][♪♪♪]You still haven'ttold anybody else?Well, I haven't seen the offer.I still don't knowif I'm gonna accept it.Why wouldn't you accept it?Are you having second thoughts?No, I'm just having...New thoughts.I don't understand.Neither do I, really.All I know is thatI'm starting to realizethat the inn is maybe a littlemore important than I thought.Is this about Willow?No.[chuckles]I'm a mother, I pay attention.It's complicated.That doesn't answer my question.What do you want, david?It's not about Willow or meor what either of us wants.It's not about selling the innor making partner.I have a little girlwho is counting on meand the decision I makeis gonna affect her entire life.So...As long as you're not puttingany pressure on yourself.[both chuckling]You're a wonderful father,david.When you needto make the decision,you'll know what to do.Thanks, mom.Come on.No, no, no. It's no problem.Truly, call any time.Thank youfor you holding down the fort.Merry Christmas.Problems?Just work stuff.You're supposed to beon vacation.I think that they are regrettingletting me leavefor quite this long.Of course they are.You're so goodat handling things.Your job, your sister's wedding,the inn.That's different.It's a labor of love.Oh, you don't love your job?Well, I do. It's different.This is all for Juni.And the-the innis just special, you know?I will agree with you there.And I thinkwhoever buys the placeis gonna be very luckythat you were there.And the right savvy investorcould reallymake a real go of it.I agree.Someone with a backgroundin hotel management,so they really knewwhat they're doing.Someone emotionally investedin the place...Way to be subtle, mom.It's a week away from Christmas.I don't have time to be subtle.I think you should buy the inn.Mom, I cannot afford it.And besides,being an assistant managerof a hoteldoes not make me qualify meto run my own business.Really? What have you beendoing for the last three weeks?Well, I've been makingto-do lists and schedules.I've been pointing at thingspeople need to do,and I'm worrying that they'renot going to get done in time.Mm-hmm, that's what runningyour business is all about.I could open upmy retirement account.No, absolutely not.I can't let you do that.And besides, what if I...What if I tried and I failed?Oh.I mean, really,what if it didn't work?I mean, it was dad's dream,and...I just couldn't saygoodbye twice, you know?[sighing][♪♪♪]Tasha, hey, it's me.I'm good, thanks. How are you?Great. Hey, listen.Could I ask you a favor, please?Would you mind sending methe informationfor the last ten hotelsthat the company's invested in?Yes.Okay, that's perfect. Thank you.[♪♪♪]Hey. What's all this?Okay, picture this.The horse-drawn carriagewith Juni in itpulls up here,comes to a stop.She gets out,she comes up this path,and as she does...Whoa!That's amazing![Willow laughing]You did all this?Well, garrett did it,but it was my idea.Well, it's a great idea.I can't waitfor natalie to see this.She's gonna love it.So, david, have you, uh...Talked anymore to that guywho was interestedmaking an offer on the inn?Yeah, yeah. We've, uh,we've been in touch.Oh. Okay. So, um...The last three weeks have...They've meant a lot to me.Being able to be here,fix up the place, I...It's like I've gotten backa piece of my past,if that makes any sense?That makes total sense.In fact, I feel the same way.- Really?- Yeah. It's likeI was waiting for a sign,and seeing this place like thiswas it.I'm so glad you said that.Because it's telling methat eagle ridge has been aroundbefore either of us,it's going to be herelong after we're gone,and it's not reallyabout who owns it,it's-it's about the memorieswe made here,and bringing the innback to lifehas given me that closure...So that I can move on.That's great, david.I am very happy for you.I owe it all to you. Thank you.Well, it's getting late.I should go.Right.'Night.Goodnight.[♪♪♪]What's wrong?What makes you thinksomething is wrong?You're eating fruitcakeout of a pan.It's good fruitcake.No, it's not.Why are you eating it?[laughing] because...I need some comfort food.I'm getting married in a week.I need comfort.You look like you coulduse some fruitcake.I don't like fruitcake.Talk to me.All right, listen.Don't tell anyone, but I...I kind of put togethera proposalabout my company maybeinvesting in eagle ridge.Investing?- Yeah.- Why?Well, I'd thoughtthat david didn't reallywant to sell it at all,that he was only letting it gobecause he was too busy,and I thought, this way,if my company put in the money,then maybe...I could run it.That would be amazing.Would your company do that?I don't know,and truthfully,it doesn't matter,because david wants to be donewith the inn.He just needs closure.Oh.I guess that's kind ofunderstandable, right?It's completely understandable.I mean,the inn represents his past,and he's ready to move on.Maybe you could buy it.Juni, I cannot afford it.Take out a loan!Unless...You don't want to do itwithout david?I can admitthat part ofwhat's made this so funhas been doing all of thiswith him... And natalie.Of course.Sounds like your feelingsfor the inn are gettingall mixed upwith your feelings for david.I only met hima couple weeks ago.I can't have feelings about him.Why not?Because...[sighs]because it's just complicated.Because I might be a personwho's pretty goodat solving problems,but I do not have a solutionfor this one.Well, maybe your answer isaccepting how you really feel.Yes, the tree! This way.Over there.[♪♪♪]All right! We're getting close!Looking good, guys.[indistinct conversations][♪♪♪][♪♪♪]Translation and subtitles byPEPPER & LALASPAIN*** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***[knocking at door]Come in.Are you okay?Mom said you needed me.I'm getting marriedin a few hours.Yes, you are.

Yeah.I mean, it's almost Christmas,and I'm getting married today.No last-minute jitters?Not a one.Well, well, maybe one or two,but that's only 'causeI hate wearing tuxedos.I don't know how you do it.I don't knowhow you stay so calm.Well, I had a good role model.Ugh, none ofthis "david is wise" stuff.No. No, no, no,that was me goofing around,but, this time, I'm serious.David, I knowI joke around a lot,but it's true, you are, like...Like the wiser,much older brother I never had.I'm not that much olderthan you.Seriously, man,look at everything you've done.With the inn...Raising natalie on your own...You're about to make partner.How you do that all at once,it's... It's amazing.Thank you.Seriously, I mean,sometimes, it just feels likeI'm being pulled alongfor the ride, you know?Ah, everybody feels like thatevery now and then,but you're gonna figure it out.You always do.It's like... like the workthat you did here with Willow.You saw an opportunityto make this placemore attractiveto the guy who wants to buy it,and it's looking good, right?Yeah, it's looking great.You see?It's all coming together.[unconvincingly] yeah.Unless...There's a part that isn't.No! It's great.Okay. Okay.Well, hey, whatever it is,you're gonna figure it out.If you think so?Yeah, yeah, I didn't make youmy best man for nothing.[laughs] all right?Can't believeyou're getting married!Yeah. I can't believe it either.[Juni sighs]I still thinkyou should tell davidabout your proposal.It's not that easy.It should be.Just... Tell him what you want.What if I'm not surewhat I want?What if it doesn't even matterwhat I want?Of course, it matterswhat you want.And... You're always sure.Remember, when we were kids,and we used to sitaround the Christmas treeand dad would ask uswhich giftwe wanted to open first?Mm-hmm.You could never decide.[both laugh]Because, I didn't wantmy first present to be...Something special,not something like socks.You knew, you always knew,where the good ones were.Mm, not this time.Right now, everythinglooks like socks.[Juni chuckles]So... What are you gonna do?You have to open something.Do I?I mean, can't I justbe here with youand eat some cookies?You could,except...I kind ofhave to start getting ready.I'm getting married today.Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are.[both chuckling]Mm.[♪♪♪]Finished.I know...We cut it a little close.You got it done in timebefore the wedding,that's all that matters.Can I see it?It's all yours.You're not gonna come in?No.I know my crew and medid a lot of the work, but...This was your vision.I think you should do iton your own.Thank you, garrett.For everything.[Willow sighs deeply][♪♪♪]Willow, this is...I know, right?I-I don't even know what to say.I mean... [chuckles]Actually, you know what?I do know what to say.Your fatherwould be very proud of you.Thank you.You're welcome.David, we need to talk.I know.Why is it so hard to knowwhat to say to you?I was just thinking that.[chuckles]I think that we should just trybeing honest with each other.You heard that I got the offerfor the inn?An offer?Yeah.Uh, robert? Right?He said it wasthe carriage ridesthat put him over.Told you.[chuckles] yeah...Are you gonna take it?I think I have to, you know?Right. The closure.Mm-hmm.You know, I just...

Yes, that's exactlywhat it means.You should always stayand fight for what you love.I know you think that this placerepresents your past,but I...I think it's your future.What kind of futurecan I have here?Every time I look around,all I see are these...These memories.That's not a bad thing.You don't have to let goof your memoriesin order to make new ones.There's always...There's room in our heartsfor more.I don't think I can.You don't want to try?I'm sorry.I just have to, um...Get ready for the wedding.[♪♪♪][hooves clopping][♪♪♪][gasps][♪♪♪][♪♪♪][doors rumbling][♪♪♪]You may be seated.Dearly beloved,we are gathered here todayto join this man and womanin the bonds of holy matrimony.So glad to see so many friendsand familyon this momentous occasion.[laughter][applauding]To a job well done.Oh.- [clink]- thank you.I knew from the moment I met youyou were a person who wasgood at taking care of things.Well...
