wrong.- Some of these kidsdon'|t wanna make anythingof their lives, butnot this kid, Ray!- I think you'|regetting a little tooattached to this case.- It'|s not a case, Ray.It'|s a person.A young girl

we were living here,it'|d be over.And I do ask that youspend a couple of hourskeeping up withyour school studies.- School studies?- Yeah, everyday.You okay with that?- Sure, why not?Well, everything wasgood until my momand dad got divorced.Minute that happened,my dad moved away.Then my mom married this,I don'|t even knowwhat you|'d call him.He was nice at first, butthen he became a jerk.My mom acted like itwas nothing at all.So I was like,"I|'m outta here."- I|'m sorry to hear that.- What about you?Why do you live inthis storage unit?- My dad's in somekind of trouble.And they wanna putme in foster home,but they can'|t catch me.- Why don'|t youlive with your mom?- She died.There is a woman that|'strying to take care of me.I think she'|s fromthe state or something.But I just don'|twant to

me.Plus, there areways to make money.You just have to workhard and pay attention.So what do youwant in your life?- I guess, for things to beback to the way they were.- You want thingsto be resolved?- Well, yeah.But that won|'t happenwhile he'|s around.- What if I told youthat miracles can happen?- I'|d say thatyou'|re full of it.What'|s that?I found it in my mom|'s things.But basically thisis how it works.You write a note to God,you put it on the ceiling,and then in thenight, he takes it.In time, all yourproblems get worked out.- That|'s the stupidestthing I ever heard of.- Well, it'|s true.- And then all yourproblems are solved?- Yeah.Try it, what haveyou got to lose?- I think that you'|re crazy.- Think what youwant, but it works.- Prove it.- Write a note to God andask for some sort of helpfor something in your life.- This is stupid.- Just close youreyes and think.- Okay.Got it.- Write it down and makesure it|'s addressed to him.- "God, please give mea new pair of shoes."- Okay, now it'|s my turn."Dear God,"thanks for my new friend."Love, Dior."- You didn'|t ask for anything.- Well sometimesI just thank himfor all that he|'s done for me.Now put it up there.And make sure thewords are facing up.- So what do we do now?- We wait until morning.- Do you ever miss your mom?- Every day.The hardest part isthat I'|ll never be ableto talk to her ever again.- What was she like?- Smart.Funny.And strong.She liked to hug me a lot.- She sounds nice.- She was.- Hey, wake up.Wake up.One of them is still there.Yours is gone butmine's still there.- I don'|t understandwhat happened.- I don'|t believein it anyways.(buzzer)(door unlocking)(ominous music)- Step forward.- Mr. Strickland, my nameis Ms. Ward and I'm fromchild protective services.- [Tim] How's my daughter?- She|'s, your daughter'|s fine.But I was hoping that youmight know where she is.- What do you mean?You don|t know where she is?- I ran into her in the park.- In the park?- She looked okay.I just don|t know whereshe'|s living at the moment.- Did you check the motel?- Yes, she|'s gonesomewhere else.- So you guy|s lost her?You don|'t have any ideawhat you'|re doing, do you?- Wait a minute here.I|'m not the

boyfriend?- No.Just remember, she|'svery resourceful.- Tim, I'|m gonna find her.- [Dior] Okay, soafter the cells divide,what'|s that phase called?- I really don|twanna do this anymore.- But you agreed to the rules.- So if I don'|t do yourrules then I have to leave?- You think that justbecause you ran awayyou can'|t thinkabout your future?- You|'re startingto sound like my mom.- Well this isn'|t it for me.I'm gonna makesomething of myself.- Well why don|'t yougo to school if it'|sso important to you?- Well that'|s outof the question.But, you did agree to studyif I let you stay here.- I'd rather liveunder the bridgethan put up withall these rules.You'|re starting tosound like my mom.- Then go.Go.(gentle music)You know, I thinkyou should go home.At least you have a mom thatcan be worried sick about you.- No, you're right, I'm sorry.I'|ll keep up withmy school stuff.I want to stay.- Good.Well, I'|m gonnatake Futt for a walk.You wanna come with?- Um no, I havesome things to do.- Okay, we'|ll

Futtman?Futtman?Futtman?Hi, Emma.Hi, what'|s goin' on?- I lost Futtman.- You did?Well let|'s go look for him.- I did, everywhere.- He'|ll show up.- I was busy fixing thiswatch and I lost track of him.- What'|s it worth?- I|'m going to find out.- So what|'s it worth?- Did you open it up?- Yeah, it had somegears out of place.- You fixed thegears in this watch?Really?- She'|s really smart.- You scratched the bezelgetting the back off.It|'ll have to be replaced.So you repaired it?- Yeah, what'|s the big deal?- You didn|'t steal it?- No, what'|s it worth?- I'|ll give you 15 for it.- 15, that'|s it?- Well, I can probablybuff the scratch out.I|'ll go 1,600.- Thanks, anyway.- All right 1,800 butthat'|s as high as I can go.- You and I bothknow this is at leastworth 4,500.- Look, I have to make a profit.- Yeah, but do you thinka 150% mark-up is fair?This isn'|t justsome ordinary watch.This has historicalsignificance.An American soldier fromWorld War One purchased this.Who knows, it could havebelonged to General Pershing.- 2,500 that'|s ashigh as I can go.- All right, you'|vegot yourself a deal.(upbeat music)- Wait just a second, girl.How did you find out howmuch the watch was worth?- I didn'|t.I would'|ve taken20 bucks for it.- Then how didyou figure it out?- Well, I knew he wanted tomake a profit of about 200%.So I calculated the 1,500and then added it to 200%.- Which is what?- 4,500.It|'s simple math, Emma.- But what about allthat stuff about the war?- It|'s all in books.Let'|s go find Futtman.(door knocking)- Did you find it?- Yeah, I'|ve dealtwith this one before.Runaway, shoplifting, priors.Parents seem nice.She just doesn'|tlike authority.- Hm.- I|'ve done thisthree times with her.Is that her?- That|'s her.Saw her today at the park.- Doesn|'t surprise me.Anything new on thatStrickland girl?- Yeah, I met withher father at county.- Really?- He seems like a sweet guy.- I'|ll bet.Bet he thinks he'|sinnocent, too.- Thing is, I don|'t think hewould do this to his daughter.What, risk going to prison?She|'s all he'|s got.- Look, you'|ve gotta stoptrying to the save the world.- I'|m not tryingto save the world.- You need to detach alittle bit from this case.Some of us are goingout after work tonight.Why don|'t you come with us?- Oh, don'|t do this to me, Ray.- Come on, get out ofyour little apartment.Have some fun.- If I say yes, willyou get out of my officeso I can get some work done?- Yes.- Okay, I'|ll go.Now get out of my office.Bye bye, Ray.- Is this it?- Yeah.I thought there was somethingfunny going on here.So I planted a security camerain the break room last night.- [Manager] Is that Terry?- [Ben] Watch, he|'sgonna put a toolin Mark'|s lunch box.- [Manager] So Markwould get fired?- [Ben] Yes.- And Terry would get promoted.- Uh huh.- Probably did thesame thing to Tim.- You want some?- No, I|'m good.- What are you writing?- I'|m just askingGod to free my dad.- You haven'|tasked that before?- Well, normally I don'|tquestion God|'s decisions,but I|'ve had enough.I just want my dad back.(door knocking)- Sit, Terry.So, how are youliking Tim|'s old job?- It|'s good, pays more.- Did you hear about Mark?- No, what happened?- We caught him stealing.- I never even trusted that guy.- He never struck meas the dishonest type.- Some guys will surprise you.- We may have to let him go.- Well, he made his own bed.- It'|s unfortunate.Mark was a goodman, hard worker.A lot like Tim was.- Look, I gotta get going.It'|s getting kind of late.- [Manager] Sure,one more thing.- When did you put acamera in the break room?- Keep watching, it gets better.I almost fired Markand promoted you.You wanna know the sad partabout this whole thing?- You'|re firing me?- Besides that.Tim went to jail forsomething you did!The police are in the otheroffice waiting for you.I just asked tohave a word with youbefore they took you away.(phone ringing)- Hey Steven, what'|s up?- You are notgonna believe this.- Oh, what|'s happened now?- Strickland didn'|t do it.- What are you talking about?- Your guy was set up.Did you hear what I said?- I heard you.When are they releasing him?- Tomorrow.- Does he know?- [Steven] Not yet.- I'|d like to be the oneto give him the good news.Can I do that, Steven, tonight?- Sure, if you want.- Tell them I|'ll bethere in 20 minutes, okay?- I'|ll let themknow you|'re coming.- You can take the cuffs off.We won|'t be needingthem anymore.- Tim, I have good news.- You found Dior?- No, but we will.You|'re being released.- What?- One of yourco-workers admitted toplanting the toolin your lunch box.- So I can go?- Once the judge signsthe paperwork, yes.Unfortunately, thatwon'|t be until tomorrow.- Did they say who set me up?- Yeah, some guy named Terry.- He seemed like a decent guy.- Anyway, one

understand.My mom doesn'|t care about me.She only cares about him.- It|'s probably nothinglike that at all.Go home, Emma.Go home and grow up.- I came here to apologize andyou'|re acting like a jerk.- Run away.Isn'|t that what you do whenyou don|'t like what you hear?- I saw your dog.- Where?- I|'m not going to tell you.Oh, and by the way,I'|m calling the police,and I|'m letting them knowyou|'re
