me some historyabout my own city.(gentle music)(upbeat music)- It's so nice of your parentsto have me over for dinner.I'm getting more than a story,they've really helpedme feel at home here.- They're great atthat, aren't they?(speaking foreign language)- Did she just say thecilantro looks sad?- She sure did.Mom likes to haggle herebecause she feels likeshe's connecting to her roots.But no one haggles in ChinaTown, it's so embarrassing.(speaking foreign language)Go ahead and taste it,they're so fresh and fragrant.The tomatoes are,they're,ugly.- Ugly.- Yep, called it.(speaking foreign language)Well, if you arereally not happy,then I'll make a seconddish for the party,and go back to Chinese school,I can barely understand you.(laughing)- Oh.Our next interviewee is ready.- Oh, you don't wannasee my mom buy beef?Mrs. Fung's husbandis the butcher,and the show alwaysreaches a climax here.(speaking foreign language)(upbeat music)- The party means so muchto what we're doing here.- It has that much of an impact?- Oh yeah, without the party,.we wouldn't have this equipmentor half the programswe have going on.As far as I'm concerned, theChangs are community heroes.- They seem like veryinspiring people.- [Eric] I certainly think so.- What do you think drives themto give back to thecommunity like this?- Oh, I think Liv cananswer that better than me.But there was a yearwhen a few familieswere having difficulty affordingthe extracurricular programs.Liv didn't want herfriends feeling left out,so she's the one thatstarted giving back.- So the red envelopeswere your idea?- The giving back part was,the envelopes and moneytree were my parents'.- You'd never imagined that.- I didn't thinkit was relevant.- To our storyit's all relevant.- I like to stay behindthe camera, remember?Anyway, I've got what Ineed here, how we looking?Should we headback to the office?- Yeah, I think I'm good here.Great.Thanks so much.- Of course,see you at the party.- Bye Liv.- Bye.(upbeat music)(upbeat music continues)- That must be a good one.- Oh, it's just a sillyphoto for another pieceI'm working on.How's our story coming?- I've got a prettysolid rough draft.Of course, we still have toactually attend the party,but the bulk of it is there.You know, Liv,we've got a chance tomake the front page here,but that might not happenif you hold that on us.- Henry, my role in the partyis not important to the story.- You don't know that,what if it is the story?- It's not.Look, I know thisis about my family,but I would still liketo maintain some boundarybetween my personaland professional lives.- Okay.I don't wanna put you inan uncomfortable position.Hopefully Andrew isn't too upsethe isn't named specifically.- Thanks, Henry, seriously.- Don't mention it.And we're

Henry, we've onlybeen talking about my familythis whole time and Iknow nothing about yours.What about you?Do you have a big,loud family too?- I was the eldest of five, soit was pure chaos growing up.- You must miss them.- I really do.My family doesn't reallycelebrate Christmas,so I wasn't expecting theholidays to make me so homesick.- If it helps.I'm sure my parents wouldbe happy to make youan honorary Chang for Christmas.- It actually does help.* O Christmas tree,O Christmas tree ** How lovely are thy branches *- What do you say? Shouldwe get out there and dance?- No, no, no, no, no way.And besides, Ihave two left feet.- Come on, where there'smusic, there's dancing.It'll be fun.* O Christmas tree,O Christmas tree ** How lovely

bummedyou don't sing upthe parties anymore.- I can't believeI just did that.Now's probably agood time to call it,I don't wanna dieof embarrassment.- Yeah, you look likeyou're having fun.How about a stroll totop of the evening?I'll walk you home.- Sure.- I had a reallygood time tonight.- Me too.Thanks for pushing meoutside of my comfort zone.- Anytime.Thanks for letting me unloadabout my family back home.- Of course, I'msure they miss youjust as much as you miss them.I'll bet they're evenbragging to anyonewho will listen about theirbrilliant journalist sonand his new life in America.- Yeah, maybe.Unless I don't cut it out here.I mean, don't get me wrong,The Bangkok Postis great and all,but this is the SanFrancisco Chronicle.I mean, that's a big deal.- Imposture syndrome,I know it well.(gentle music)Henry, Charles wouldn'thave taken a chance on youif he didn't thinkyou were great.I mean, front page potential,and from what I've seen,you're thorough, compassionate,good with people, you care.And once this article comesout, everyone is gonna see that.(gentle music)Oh no.- Oh, well look at that.- I can't believe it, this hasmy mom written all over it.I mean, there might aswell be a sign that says,"My daughter lives here,somebody kiss her."It's too much.- She sure doesgo the extra mile.Well, I guess I shouldprobably get home.- Yeah, yes, totally.Thanks, I'll see youat work tomorrow.- Of course, sounds good.- Okay.(gentle music)(upbeat music)- Morning, Liv.- Oh hey, Henry, morning.- Hey, I got you something,a little mementofrom last night.- That's very funny.- Snagged it on my wayto work this morning,figured I'd eliminate the threatof any unwanted affection.- Well, it's the nicestgift I've ever received.- Good, you're bothhere, in my office.There's some good stuff here.We got Christmas and funand community and spiritand so on and so on.But it's not there, youknow, something's missing.We gotta dig deeperinto the Chang familyto get to theheart of the story.- Yeah, I know.I may have held back onsome of those details.- Well put them in there,the reader wants apersonal connection.- Actually, there'ssomething I need to confess.The thing is, Henry heldback because I asked him to.- You asked him to?Well, why exactlydid you do that?- Wow, well, that didn'tgo as well as I'd hoped.I don't think I've seen Charlesthat disappointed before.Surprised he didn'ttake me off the story.- He didn't take you off becauseyou are great at your job.He knows this is complicatedand that it tookguts coming clean.I'm proud of you.(phone rings)- Oh, Henry, I gotta run,I have to go pick upthe red envelopes.- I'll come with you.- It's okay, I'll be quick,and you're busy with the story,you have threedays to rewrite it.- This is the story.I'm not gonna find it bysitting behind a computer.- Let's roll.- Thank you, Mrs. Chen.- So that was the last one.- Thanks for being my pack mule.- My pleasure.- So you ready to lug thatbag back to my parents?- Sure.But instead of walking,there's something I've beenwanting to do since I got here,and now would be theperfect opportunity.(upbeat music)- Henry, careful, you'rebeing such a tourist.- I basically am a tourist.Come on, join me, live a little.- Sir, sit down please.- Henry, you're gonnaget us kicked off.- Don't tell me you'velived here all your lifeand you've never hung offthe side of a cable car?- I definitely have not.- I'm gonna tell youthis is a friend,I think your brother's right,you need to stopworrying so much aboutwhat other people think of you.- Okay, friend.But I think that there'sa difference between thatand acting like a civilizedmember of society.And please don'tside with Andrew.- I don't know, Ithink he's got a point.Of course, if youwanna prove me wrong.(upbeat music)- Merry Christmas San Francisco.- Merry Christmas San Francisco.- You two hooligans areoff at the next stop.- Hooligans.Henry, where did the bag go?Excuse me, have youseen where our bag went?Did anyone knowwhere our bag went?(gentle music)(somber music)(somber music continues)Must have searched a 10block radius and nothing.What am I gonna do?My parents are gonna kill me.- Oh perfect timing.Henry, I hope youbrought your appetite.What's wrong?You lost it, all of it.- That's bad, even for you.- How are we supposedto tell everyone thatwe lost all their money?- Mr. and Mrs. Chang,this is really my fault.We both took turnscarrying the bag,but I should have madesure we still had it.- I knew we shouldn'tlet her do it.It's our tradition, Ivy.- I thought it would benice to pass this on to Liv,to get her to reconnectto the party again.- Why are you alwaystrying to force meto be a part of all of this?You know I don't like beingthe center of attentionlike you do, that'swhy I take the photos.- You don't need you to bethe center of attention,we need you to be a part ofthis family for Christmas.We want you to care justa little about the party,about this family.If you did, maybe thiswouldn't have happened.- Care?I think the problem isI've always cared too much.I don't want this family tobe a target for ridicule.That's why I had toset some boundaries.- You can't get mad at usfor trusting you to handlesomething so simple.- Simple, this isanything but simple.Why do we have to displayenvelopes on a treefor everyone to see?You always makeeverything this big show,and you expect me tobe someone I'm not.This party is a circus,and it's embarrassing.- I didn't realize we weresuch an embarrassment.- Mom, I didn't...- No, ah, no, I understand now.My daughter's ashamed of us.Your father and Iwill handle this.We'll apologize toeveryone at the party,we'll tell them thatwe lost the money.Don't worry about saving face,in fact, it'll be bestif you didn't come.(gentle music)(phone ringing)- Hi.- Good morning.I wanted to seehow you're doing.- I'm taking amental health day.- I hate to bother you, but westill have a story to submit.It's a tight deadline.- Henry, I can't be a partof this story anymore.- Liv.- I'm serious, I'veruined everything.My parents don't evenwant me at the partyand I don't blame them.So for now, I needsome time alone, okay.- Okay.- I took some great photos,so just choose your favorites.(gentle music)- Thank you for agreeingto talk with me again,I know it's not the besttiming after last night.- We're sorry youhad to see that.- We appreciate you caringabout our story so much.Hopefully we're stillfront page worthy.- There's a reallyspecial story here,I just wanna makesure I get it right.Is it okay if I set up a camerato make sure I get everything?- Of course.(upbeat music)Well, I hope you're ready toget your hands dirty again.- You know it.Oh, and before I forget, Igot something for you too.- Oh, you didn't haveto get us anything.- Ah, just a little thank you.- Oh, I love it.- Thank you.- All right, well let'sstart putting togethersome goody bags.- Okay, there's a wholesystem here, Henry,so follow along closely.First off, we havethese little jars ofLiv's special hot chocolate.And despite whathappened last night,I have to admit it's delicious.So into the bag it goes.Next, we have pepperminttea, some candy,and Liz's specialChristmas fortune cookies.- Liv's done a lot this year.- I know she acts likeshe's too sophisticatedfor our party, but shedoes have a good heart.- Maybe it's becausewe're her parents,but we always want everyoneto know how amazing she is.- Even when we're mad at her.(upbeat music)* Father Christmas ** I'm writing to youfor forgiveness ** Walking alonein the stillness ** Wishing it wasn't this way ** On this holiday ** Snow is falling ** Won't you put hopein the stocking ** I'll take somejoy if you got it ** Is there somethingfor this pain ** Packed up in your sleigh *- Welcome back.- You remember me?- Of course.You came in with thattall, handsome man.How are you?- Honestly not great.I kind of ruinedChristmas for my family,an entireneighborhood, actually.- I'm sure it's not that bad.- Oh no, it is.I didn't just ruin a party.I lost thousandsof dollars intendedfor the kids inour neighborhood.I called my parentsan embarrassment,even though the entirecommunity loves them.And now they're gonna leteverybody down because of me.And that tall, handsome man,well, I basically abandoned himwhile he tries topick up the piecesof the disaster I've caused.- Oh, I see.May I?This party would it happen tobe the big Christmas soiréethat happens a fewblocks from here?- You know about it?- Well, I'm usually in thecathedral when it happens,but I hear it's a real joy.It's strange how a time of yearso filled with joy and hopecan also be thecause of heartache.In the grand scheme of things,I believe Christmassymbolizes a timeof communities coming togetherand refuge for those whoneed it, even when it's dark.Follow me dear.Fortunately, darknessis easy to drive away.Sometimes we just need alittle help from our neighbors.That's why sharing ourlight is so important.You never know who elsearound you might need it.- Are you an angel?- Oh no, I've justlived a long life,but I am a neighborif you need one.- Thanks.(gentle music)(gentle music continues)(gentle music continues)- We got these made specialfor the 25th anniversary.- Hey, stuff and talk you guys,I'm not gonna fillall these bags myself.- This is from the20th anniversary,the year Santa showed itup to help me hand outmy sesame candy canes,didn't go over so well.- I am curious though,why infuse all theChinese elementsinto your Christmas party?- Chinese and Christmastraditions just go together.I mean, red and greenare lucky colors,so our decorations werealready made for Christmas.- Jack and I just wanted toreconnect with our roots,you know,and share that Asian family joywith our childrenand our community.- It's also why we used tohave Liv sing at the party.We wanted her to feelproud of her heritageand feel the love andstrength for the communitythat loves her.You should have seen how movedthe Chinese families werewhen they saw a littleLiv in their cheongsam,singing a Christmastune in Cantonese.They loved it,everybody loved it.- Yeah, I know, we canbe a little over the top.Okay, a lot over the top.- We just like to put ourown spin on everything,but that's what beingChinese American is.It's the best of bothworlds and a hot pot mess.(upbeat music)(upbeat music continues)- Merry Christmas to you.Merry Christmas.- Writer's block?- Welcome back, how wasyour mental health day?- Very productive actually,thank you for sendingme the interview,it was exactly whatI needed to hear.- I'm glad.- I think I was so caught up inhow the party was affectingme all these years,I completely lost sightof the incredible peoplewho put it on.- They really are something.- I wanna apologize foreverything that's happened.I know I've made amess out of things.I let my own baggagealmost derail the story.I hid the truth of who I amfrom you and from Charles,which could have scrappedyour first assignment.I'm done runningfrom that person now.- I'm happy to hear it.- And I think I know a wayto raise back the donationsI lost.- You do?What do you have in mind?- Let's consult an expert first.(upbeat music)There he is.- This is your expert?- An expert inbeing Changtastic.- What up least favorite child?- Oh, I'm glad to see you too.- Henry.- Hey.- So what's up?- I wanted to tell youthat you were both right.I spend way too muchtime caring aboutwhat other people think.- Called it.- And you bothdeserve the full truthas to why I run from Liv Changand became just Liv Rose.- Wow, this is serious.- This whole messstarted in seventh grade,the last year Isang at the party,and it turned out to be themost embarrassing momentin my life.I actually likedsinging for everyone,and I loved the redcheongsam grandma bought me,I was so excited to show it off.So I invited a fewgirls from my class.They recorded me and sent itout to everyone at school.So for the rest of junior high,all the kids wouldmake fun of me,singing to me ina Chinese accent.- Liv, that's awful.- Looking back,I wish I didn't give intoa bunch of basic bullies,but after that, I wasn'treally myself anymore.I was trying to blend in,but also feeling guilty fortrying to distance myselffrom everything Chinese.I'm really not embarrassed ofour family or of the party,I'm embarrassed of myself,but I'm not even sure if Iknow who myself is anymore.- You know you don't haveto be one thing or another.You can be everything you are,artist, amateur baker,annoying sister.You know what it helps me out,knowing that hater's gonna hate,but you, mom and dad alwaysgot my back, no matter what.- Thank you for havingmy back, both of you.(gentle music)- I think other peopleshould hear this.I'm sure you're not the onlyone who has felt this way.- Well, that's why Ibrought you both here today.It's time to show everyonewho I am, all of me.I just hope they still likeme once they get to know me.- They'll love you.- Yeah, just be yourself,but you know, less weird.- Okay.- Hi everyone, I'mcoming to you livebecause there'ssomething importantI have to get off my chest.Most of you know me as LivRose, the photographer.But there's a part of me I'veavoided for a very long time.My name, my full nameis Liv Rose Chang.And my family and mycommunity need your help.(triumphant music)(upbeat music)(upbeat music continues)- Whoa, this sweatercosts 90 bucks.- Why is there a moneytree in the backyard?I thought witheverything that happened,we weren't gonna have one.- Relax, there's nomoney in the envelopes.- Then why did you do that?Any minute now I'm gonnahave to go out thereand tell everyone thatthere is no money.The tree will stillbe nice to look at.- It's okay, son,your mom's just a littlehigh strung tonight.You haven't heard fromyour sister, have you?- I thought you toldher not to come.- We did, but that doesn'tmean we don't want her here.- Thank you, thank you.- Welcome.- Hi.- Where are you guys?- Mom and dad are flipping out.We're almost there,is everything ready?- I'm just waiting on you.- Hope you're ready for aparty you'll never forget.(upbeat music)(upbeat music continues)- Whoa.- Yeah, that's the right word.(upbeat music)(upbeat music
