Bieber?He's just not aquality musician.His chord progressionsare derivativeand the use ofauto-tune is obsessive.You're crazy.He's perfect.He has the voiceand hair of an angel.That hair, it's a distraction.He's just anotherformulaic pretty boyserved up by the music industry.You're so mean.Nobody will be your friend.Ladies, ladies.Why are you pickingon the new girl?She said Justin Bieberwas deriva-something.She said his music was bad.Well his choices arepedantic and immature.He's carefully packagedand lacks nuanceand emotion and structure.But Stefani, you're thepresident of his fan club!Well, I am goingto marry him someday.I mean he's gorgeous and richbut our prenup will sayI never have to listento his ridiculous music.Thanks.I'm Stefani.I like your shirt.I'm Pearl.You should come to my house.I just got the newSufjan Stevens album.Okay.We've been bestfriends for eight years.Pearl, we won'tstop being besties.Okay.Stef, that's not my point.My point is that weare very differentbut the thing that's alwaysunited us is our music.I don't understand howyou can't see that, Stef.I just, I don'tneed it like you do.But you do, Stefani.You need the voicemusic gives you.Well she's outgrownthis little hobby.Stay out of this, Bob.He's right.I'm done.Excuse me, young lady.In America we try torespect our elders,probably doesn'teven speak English,sponging off our tax dollars.See?It means I am American,and you actually ran into me.Yeah, well, hey,I would get yourpaperwork in orderbefore you start mouthing off.I'm here to see Adam Song.Oh, he's my Uncle,but he's in a class so youcan make an appointment.Oh, an appointment, okay.Well, could you please tell him-Can I help you?I'm Adam.Thank you.Sir.Your niece was just about tothrow me out of the building.I'm sorry.Can I got a moment?I believe he needsan interpreter.I think he's deaf.Yes, I got the gistof the exchange, Paul,thank you very much.This place is quite amenagerie, isn't it?Hello.Would youlike to come into my office?No.No, that won't be necessary.I'll be very brief.The Kings have sold theirhalf of the buildingto my brother and I,and our plans unfortunatelydo not includea cute little get-togetherspace here, so,we're going to haveto kindly ask you tovacate the premisesin the next 30 days.We have acontract with your companyand the Kings foranother three years.So even though you decidedto buy this building,they wanna make surethat we continue runningour place here.And we pay thefirst of the month.You can't kick us out.Yeah, excuse me.You might wanna check clause13F of your contract there.It says if you'redelinquent in any way,then the lease renewal issubject to a provable solvencyfor the following year.Wehave a monthly pledge,we have annual grants.And our money tendsto be variablebut we have neverbeen late on our rent.Ooh, another mistake.I think last Decemberthey were lateand the December before that.Okay, wait a minute.The Kings covers one monthevery year from their grantsand so their money gettingtransferred to our accounttakes a couple days.Stop, look.My hands are tied.Your income isinconsistent, hmm?Grants, donationsand all of that,they're not guaranteed.But look, just look atit from my point of view.What if a tenant, areliable tenant comes to meand says I want the placefor a year or more or 10,who knows how many years?And I don't give it tothem, I give it to you.And the following monthyou come to me and sayoh I'm sorry Mr. Neville,but could you please,could you justgive us a little extension?That's not good business.That just won'twork, correct Paul?No.So I'm gonna haveto ask you to placeyour very favorable30,000 dollars annual rentinto an escrow accountbefore the end of this termwhich is 30 days.30 days?That's impossible.Look, Mr. Sing, Song,I'm not a monster, hmm.How about I giveyou another 10 days?Call it a gift.That takes you to,well that takes you to the 24th.Now there's a day you shouldbe able to remember, hmm?You either pay upor you get out.Paul.Thank you, thank you, thank you.And the prize for pin asperm on the egg goes to,Greg Rodriguez!Somebody knows their way aroundwith a blindfold.And the winner of baby bottlebowling goes to Christopher.Oh, hey.And some people knowtheir way around a nipple,that's all I'm saying.Hey.I thought bowling wasmore about powerful balls.Ohit's a family event,boys, come on.And the winner for the mostcreative baby name goes toGrandma Song for VermouthCompression Socks.I though thatwas the shopping list.And the winnerof baby Song gamegoes to our smarty pantscollege girl Jules.Yeah!No.Stay here.Mom?Yes?You're gonna needto let go, mom.I need you to stay here.I miss you so much.Well.And now Susan andCole are gonna opentheir baby gifts, okay?Oh yeah.Hey.Hey.It is so itty bitty.It's so cute.Oh.It is so cute.Is mommy hurt?No, Billie.She's just very, very happy.Then why is she crying?Well, because she'salso very, very crazy.Don't worry, kiddo.It's not permanent.At least I hope not.Have you met my ex-wife?Grandpa.Are you trash talking Mormor?Just making conversation.I hear that.Oh, grandpa.I never met the guy.Sure.There's gotta be something.You are so weak, Paul.This is the sort of thingthat should have gonethrough my lawyer.I don't seethe problem, Aiden.You found a clause thatcan work in our favor.That's right, I found it.But that contract would havebeen much more in our favorif you had involvedme in the first place.But you heard them.There's no way they can comeup with that kind of moneyin 40 days.There are no new grantsthis time of year.Everyone is begging.You do understandthat this is whyfather left me incomplete controlof all company decisions.But mother leftmajority controlof the property to me, and,I don't think she'd approveof putting these kids outon Christmas eve.Yeah, becauseshe was soft like you.Of course she knew thatyou'd be helpless on your ownso she wanted to makesure that her babyhad a safety net.Don't insult mother.She was a saint.You'd better hope thatthey do not figure this out.This is a multi-milliondollar development dealthat depends on usacquiring the entire blockthat is 5,000 square feetof prime retail space.A lot more valuable thanthese kids' little playground!I'm telling you, if they doraise the money, if they do,you, big brother,you are gonna haveto figure it out.Not me!You do realize,that that clause givesthem an automatic renewalfor two years on the leaseif they raise themoney this year.You put that together?Look at me.You're pathetic.I just overheard something.And you need to get thatcontract looked over again.We only need one year's rent.Well that's something.They'reall yours, Grandpa.Thanks, Dylan.Is everybody here?Yeah, everybody ispresent and accounted for.Okay.Uncle Adam's community center.Now we all know how much goodUncle Adam's done forthe last two yearswith at-risk families.Now they have until Christmasto raise 30,000 dollarsor they are out on the streets.Now I can make some calls butwe have got to get creative.We're still getting alittle bit of ad revenuefrom the talent show video.You know, Grannies on the Go,they're always lookingfor new programs.Maybe we could pairup lonely seniorswith at-risk youthand kill two birdswith one bullet.I think you meanstone, Grandma.Well, that doesn't make sense.I mean, how would you killtwo birds with one stone?I mean, with a bulletyou just line them upand it's a clean shot.You know what, she'sgot me there, yup.You know, I love the idea.Can you make some calls?We can put up donationcans at my officeand at the gym.Yeah.We can have a bake sale.As long as youdon't eat the profits.I can sell some of my toys.That'svery sweet, Billie.You know what, maybe wecould sell Theo's trumpet.I'm getting better.I'm joining Pearl'sband when I get big.That's right.You know, Theo, Ilike the sound of that.Oh, don't sayit, Judy Garland.Why not?We have so much talent here,we could put together ashow and broadcast it live.There is thatstage at the center.I mean, the soundsystem needs some work.Frank?And I can decorate it.I could get my socialmedia class to helpwith the marketing.But we only have five weeks.Whoah, whoah,whoah, whoah, hold on.What about school?And how about songsfor a new label?I've been prettystuck recently.This could be theinspiration I need.I'm in.You know what, me too.I think we're all in.We're crazy.You guys, I hate tobreak up this family momentbut I've gotta getto the airport.- Oh no.- Why?Safe travels.- We'll miss you.- Oh, Jules.- Oh.- Come here.I need a group hug.Group hug!Okay I have to getthat flight now for real.Hey Frank,can I talk to you?Yeah, what's up?I have another idea.A backup plan, but,I'll need some help.Does it involvebreaking any laws?Ethical or judicial?Possibly.Then I'm in.Hey, sweety.How was band practice?Oh.It was all right.We can live without a saxand Haley and Car are pickingup the harmonies, but,we are reallyfeeling her absence.I always knew I needed her butthis feels very different.But you know, we'reworking out the kinks.It'll be all right.Yeah, I get it.Are you okay?I'm....I'm just missing Jules.The plane landedan hour ago, butI know there's 13 kidsrunning around, but,it's like the shape of thefamily changed when she left.Yeah I miss her too, yeah.I can go get Frankand we can insult eachother for your amusementif you'd

decisions.Aiden always said that-- Let me tell youa story from 1961.Are you gonna fly me backto our house on Cornell?Always theflair for the dramatic.No, there are specialeffects everywhere now.We prefer to keepit simple, hmm.Where was I?Oh yes, back atthe little house.We were so poor then,why we only had one maidwho just came in weekly.Mildred.Now every Thanksgiving,your father would bringMildred a huge turkeyand bags of groceries.And when you weresix, he let yougive Mildred her gift.I forgot thebag with the pies.Hmm, he made you ride downtownto take them to thatpatched up little house?I'd never seena place like that.Mildred was serving foodto a dozen people in rags.She could have eaten for a weekbut she gave most everybit to the others.And what did youfather tell you?That she was a fool.You have to take care ofyourself and your family.Father confessed he wastrying to toughen you upbut that soon he would teach youhow important peoplelike Mildred were.You see, in that room perhapsthere was a hungry childwho would find thecure for cancerif only someone gave him hope.After that, hebrought Mildred foodfor every holiday.Really?But father always saidthat you have to takecare of yourself.I guess he didn'tlive long enoughto teach you and Aiden themost important lessons.Oh, he built strong spinesbut he never got achance to show youhow the heart is most important.Wish I would have knownthis side of father.And now I needto go, my darling.But I still haveso many questions.Tell me.Oooh, I hear theangels calling me.Now just lean back and closeyour eyes for a moment.What the

thingis about if you're Chinese.My birth mom is Muslimso I get to hug everyone threetimes and give them a date.Not like the kissingkind of date, yuck.This kind is a fruit.Maybe I will leave youone instead of cookies.I'm from a place called Syriabut you probably knew that.I hope you go there alot on Christmas Evebecause there are lots of sadchildren there with no toys.Plus I don't want anytoys for Christmasor Eid, or whatever.I just want other kids toget mommies, that's all.Can you please bringall the kids in Syriaand wherever they don'thave the mommies and daddiesbecause they are the best thing.No offense to the elvesbut mommies are betterthan any other crap,sorry, they make.I got Kwanzaa, Eid,Christmas, Hanukkah, T-time.Your friend, Theo.#alliwantforchristmasismoremommsOh Theo, that'sjust beautiful.Thanks, Grandma.Only, is there a Santa?'Cause Andrea said there wasn't.Or why didn't those kidsin Syria already get toys?Well, Theo.Someone very wise once told methat just becausesomething isn't realdoesn't mean it's not true.As long as you believe.Thanks, Pearl.I'm gonna go read to mommy.I hope she doesn't crazy cry.You want some help movingthat keyboard upstairs?Yeah, sure.I think I'm ready togo write that song.Pearl.Hi.Did you get it?Yeah, I did.Hi, Pearl.I hope you are well.Hi, Robert.I just came by to talkto Stef for a sec.Well she certainlydoesn't need my permissionto talk with an old friend.How progressive of you.Guys.I really did like it, Pearl.Thank you.But you're my sounding boardand I am not quitefinished with it yet.I need a Stef breakdown.Well that, thatwas a nice catchup,but she's not in themusic game anymore.Robert, it'sjust a conversation.What, you get suckedinto things like thisbecause they're fun, easy,intellectual bubble gumand then you lose focus.It's not bubble gum.Stefani, I'mtrying to help you.I mean, you're a beautiful girl.But if you persistin wasting your timeon frivolous pursuits,you'll never developany functional skills.So you're just sayingI have nothing elseto offer the worldbesides being pretty?Sweetheart, you know nothingabout politics or history.Technology, business, sports.I mean you're not unintelligent.You have tremendous potential.But you insist on fillingyour pretty little headwith things that don't matter.And then, there'sno more room leftfor the things that do.To you.What?Things that don'tmatter to you.Stef is an encyclopedia ofpop culture, art, fashion.Things that inspire peopleand make them feel things.That is so incredibly important.And if you cared about herhalf as much as youcare about yourself,you would see howfreaking brilliant she is.Pearl.I'm sorry.I just have oneproblem with the song.What?I don't see any place fora killer saxophone solo.Bob?This is ridiculous,you kidding me?Listen, here's whatI'm gonna tell you.You are not Guccimaterial, okay?Bye.And also one more thing,No, freaking Bob.I've missed you.I'm finally giving up on men.We're gonna go all golden girlsand live together as old maids.No, seriously, a boy, who?Maybe.And maybe Logan French.Shut up, seriously?To heck with the song.You're gonna needprofessional adviceand maybe a tweezer, come on.Thank you allfor coming so soon.Please, pass them down.Is everything okay, Aiden?Uh, yes, no, well,we had a problemand then a solutionalbeit a difficultone for me personally.The first document thereis the initial reportthat we handed out to investors.It includes expenses to dateas well as all the accepted bidsfor phase two of theSt. Matthews project.Now the second document, theone that you've just received,I just discovered ina second set of booksbeing kept by my brother.You'll notice that inthe initial report,all the figures, theexpenses, the bidsare all much higher thanin the second reportwhich indicates to me thatmy misguided brother,has been cooking the books.Why, I don't know.I suppose to tap into themargins that he created,I don't know.But my fastidious oversightcaught this in time.And I do not think that thisis an insurmountable problem.I don't understand, Aiden.These numbers seemto be identicaland include notarized copiesof the bids and receipts.Please hold.Yes, it appears that Tessahas copied the same report.No, the numbers matchbut the reports havedifferent dates and fontsand only one hasthe backup data.What's going on, Aiden?Should we be concerned?No, no, no no.I've just been handedincorrect informationbut rest assured, I willget to the bottom of this.In the meantime, knowthat all accountshave been locked.Nobody can touchthem, money is safe.You don't need to be concerned.Hi.Mrs. Green, I'm Selena.And I'm Babbette, butmy friends call me Babe.So excited to get started.This is our first.Both, not together.We both have baby daddies.AKA husbands.I'm
