So you knew my mom and youthink it's okay to like my dad?Elliot, I barely knewyour mom,you know, and I've beengetting your daddy's coffeefor over a year nowand never knew that Janey--well, you know, I just wantedto make you all a nice dinner.It's just really weird.No wonder she did bad in L.A.That was a terrible performance.I think you guysowe Dani an apology.Oh.Ah.Mm...Oh, my.You know, those ungratefullittle heathens.I mean, those Cornish hens,those are a real pain in my--Oh. Just a minute.Okay.You all right?Yeah, I'll be fine.I'm really sorry.I mean, this whole situation'sjust so new for everybody,and they're just--Right.I completely understand.I mean, I knowbecause I lost my motherover the holidaysand I know exactlywhat they'regoing through, so...- I'm sorry. I had no idea.- I do, I do.Uh...Sorry.Elliot, are you okay, honey?Well, if it's any consolation,your mother didn't carefor Dani either.But that information is strictlybetween us big kids.Pinky swear?And I only say thatbecause your daddy needsto find out for himself.He probably thinkshe's doing what's rightfor you kids right now,but he's a smart man.Just give hima little time, okay?But I thought she saidshe didn't know Mom that well.Mom didn't like her?Honey, your mamaliked everyone.It was Dani who was jealousof your mom.Why?Well, backwhen they were seniors,your mom was votedthe most popular in schooland somehow Dani claimed that the ballots had been rigged,but when they did a recount,Janey won by a landslide.Can you imagine?Daniela Downy must havefake cried the whole way home."Oh-hh!"Ahem.Guys, is there somethingyou'd like to say to Dani?Sorry.Is there anything elseyou want to say to Dani?Food?Thanks for the food.Yes, thank you, Dani.Oh, you are so welcome.I actually made the same mealfor the homelessdown at the shelters.Quite a treat.Well, that's very nice of you.And, guys, since Dani doesn'thave any family to go home tofor the holidays, I told herthat she could spendthe holidays with us,okay?And thank you so much.I mean, you don't knowhow much this means to me.I thought I was gonnahave to spend the holidaysall by myself in my drearylittle housebut, oh, we get to make piesand play gamesand, oh, it's just gonna bethe best holiday ever together!Oh, I got lots to do.Oh, no. Oh.How do I--?
