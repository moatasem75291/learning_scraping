Yes, Theodore?Your pardon, Countess,but a letter for the Princess.Well, take it up to her.He's afraid to, Mama.

I hit it in seven shots today.Good afternoon, Theresa.How are my late husband'sdear relatives?We're all fine, Olympia.I have a letter for you.I'm not sure I should read it.It will probably send meinto one of my fits.Can't you control your fits?I mean, if you know ahead of time.Control of the emotions, Theresa,is a mark of the middle classes.However, I suppose I could try.- What does it say?- It says no.Or at least, not yet.My father keeps telling the Emperor howwell-behaved I'll be if I'm allowed back...but the Emperor just sayshe'll think it over.Are you going to have a fit?I don't think so. It's too hot.Olympia, why was the Emperorso strict?Just because of you and that captain?- He didn't actually kill himself.- He tried.The fact that he missed simply calledattention to his common origin.Also, I was a widowjust out of mourning.You'd be surprisedhow stuffy some people are about that.So, here I am. Banished and bored.And not a presentable man under 50within miles.There must be other thingsin life besides men.For peasant women, perhaps.But for us, what do we have...except the fact thatGod divided us into two sexes...like the lower orders, only more so?But you must admitthe scenery here is beautiful.Scenery?It's what goes onin front of the scenery that counts.The desperate pleading of a mandriven mad by his love for you.Your heart meltingin the flame of his desire.Yes?Not yet. I'll tell you the restin another year or two.I'm tired of shooting.- Would you like to do me a favour?- Anything, Olympia.Would you go to the stables andtell them to saddle the Arab stallion?Maybe on a horseI can outrun my boredom.The stallion's wild, Olympia.Why don't you take the mare?Because I can't stand the sightof another female, that's why.No one's allowed to ride the stallion.Allowed? May I ask who in this castleis of higher rank than I?Will you be back for dinner?If I go far enough...I may stay overnightat the hunting lodge.You can signal meif there's anything important.I will. I'll ring the tower bells.Miss.Miss, are you hurt?Let's see the pulse.I'll need my first-aid book. Let's see."The brain... Can be flushed from..."A pale... Ankle... Past the head."Loosen clothing..."and keep the patient lying down..."with his head and shouldersslightly raised. If his face is..."No, I better not do that."Keep the patient warm, but do not..."Well, let's see."Heated objects... Unconscious patient."If he's strangling from bloodor mucous in the throat...""Keep the patient warm."I'll have to get some help. Let's see.Where am I?I'm coming.Thank God, I thought you were...Are you all right?Don't move.You may have broken something.I won't stir.You never know in a fall.If you'll excuse the liberty...- just let me know where it hurts.- All over.Ticklish. Here.Nothing seems to be broken,but I better get you home.I'll get the car started.You just take it easy right here.- I will.- Just rest now.- I can't get the car started.- No?I think it's the ignition.Must've gone outwhen I went through that fence.How sad. Is it badly hurt?I can fix it, but it'll take timeand it's getting late.You live far from here?Very far.But there is a hunting lodge nearby.We could go there.All right. Here, let me help you up.Put this on.- Do you think you can walk it?- No.I think you'll have to carry me.I'm not in very good shape right now.It's just over the hill,and you can rest along the way.I don't want you to get all tired out.You have so much work to do...- fixing the car and...- We can coast down the hill in the car.It's all right, we'll walk.Over there.Anybody here?Hello?Over there.Over there.Excuse me.You sure that lady won't mind?The one you said owns this place?You can take my word. The Princesswould just love your being here.She must be very generous.Oh, yes. And beautiful.And intelligent. Highly intelligent.I see. Well, it's getting dark in here.Oh, yeah.It's sure a good thingyou knew about this place.We could've been stuckin the middle of nowhere...exposed to the night and the cold.We could've been in real danger.I'm not sure we're out of it yet.Another kind of danger, I mean.Oh, yeah. How do you feel now?- My head hurts a little, but...- I've got some stuff in my medicine kit.An American headache remedy.I'll just go get it.It doesn't hurt that much.You can get it later.Now you must sit down and rest.Excuse me.- Are you an American?- From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.- What class?- Class?Class of '99, University of Pennsylvania.I'm a mining engineer.By the way, my name is Charles Foster.My friends call me Charlie.My name is...Well, I can't think of it.You must have amnesia from the fall.I'd better get...Lucrezia is my name. Lucrezia Strauss.- Plain Lucrezia Strauss.- I wouldn't say plain.No, sir, not plain at all.- Are you cold?- A little.You're sweet, Charlie.Yeah.- Maybe I could build a fire.- Yeah.You know, maybe I've hadthe wrong idea about royalty.I've always thought of themas something to get rid of...things that stood in the way of progress.I never really thought of them as people.They're people, all right.Do you work for them?My father does.And you just help your motheraround the house?- Not exactly.- What do they make you do?Work out in the fields,milk the cows and all that?How did you guess?I come from a family of farmers, too.What you call peasants over here.I know one when I see one.There we are. Say, what's the matter?Can you talk? Are you all right?I'd better get...Boy, you really had me scared.Are you sure you're all right now?I'm fine. Just fine.I'm going to get that medicine kitjust the same.- You don't mind?- Not if you come back.- I'll be back.- Quickly.As quickly as I can.You never can tell.You might have another attack...and I'm responsible for you.Excuse me.Look what I found.Wine and cheese and bread.The bread's not very fresh,but you won't mind, will you?And you brought your suitcase.How clever.- I can't work on the car until morning.- What a shame.- Here, have a glass of wine.- Thank you.I don't think you understand.We'll have to spend the night here.I understand.- Cheese?- No, thank you.It's kind of an unconventional situation.Yes, isn't it?Neither of us planned it this way,of course.- Certainly not.- You know, you're a remarkable girl.- Am I?- I mean, the way you take all this.- So calm and unafraid.- I believe in making the best of things.That's the peasant in you.Are you all right?- Why, you don't even know who I am.- Of course I do.You're an American of the 99th class.I could be the kind of man who'dtake advantage of a situation like this.- But you're not.- Listen, don't get me wrong.- Men are men everywhere.- What kind of a man are you?But we have to be carefulthat we don't...let our feelings carry us...No. I'm going to fix the car.Then I'm going to take you home.Charlie. My head.Don't leave me, Charlie.- What is it? Another attack?- Charlie.I've got some great stuff here.It'll fix you right up.It'll make you feel much better. Here.Here, take this.It tastes terrible.This'll kill the taste. Drink this.You never know with a concussion.You feel fine,and all of a sudden, wham!It's not medicine I need. It's rest.Will you take me tothe bedroom, please?Well, I don't know. I don't think I should.You want me to walk, in my condition?- No, of course not.- Over there.Yes.- I feel better already.- Yeah?You can't sleep this way. Wait a minute.Here, put these on.- They'll be a little big for you.- I don't mind.Just let me knowwhen you've got them on.Are you here on business, Charlie,or is this your holiday?Business.I've been investigating some depositsof a mineral called bauxite.Been testing the purity in percentageof the ore.Never mind the details.Anyway, bauxite is madeinto aluminium.My company's interestedin manufacturing it here.Since I'm the only representativewe have...I have to be bothsalesman and engineer.- Charlie?- Yes?Will you come and say good night?If you're ready.Yes.I want you to take some more of thisbefore you go to sleep.We should get to know each otherunder normal circumstances.I should meet your friends,and your family.I'm sorry,I don't know why I'm so suddenly...Did you give me somethingto put me to sleep, in the wine?No, of course not.All I put was the medicine in there.It's for headaches.You can read it yourself."For the relief of pain due to shock..."- Oh, no.- I knew it.It says not to mix with alcohol unlessyou want the patient to go to sleep.That's what you wanted.No, I really didn't know.But I think it was just as well.Coward."Back with the car when fixed.I know it now, I love you."Hello. Have you seen a girlaround here?Tall, blonde, beautiful?She was wearing a white blouseand a red skirt.- Where?- Right around here.Maybe you know her.Her name is Lucrezia Strauss.I just went to get the car ready,and when I came out...- Say, where's her horse?- I have seen no horse and no girl.But you can't come herewith that machine.This is a private estate.I can't worry about that.I have to find her.Maybe you can worry about this.Olympia!Theresa. What is it?- From Vienna.- From Vienna?- Good news?- The best. I can go back.- The Emperor has changed his mind.- That's wonderful, Olympia.Tell them to get the carriage readywhile I pack.Vienna, the last, the mostglorious week of the season.- Theresa.- Yes?- Will you take a message for me?- To whom?No, it wouldn't accomplish anything.Order the carriage.Mama.- Darling, you look wonderful.- Thank you.- The mountain air agrees with you.- The Emperor forgave me.Yes, dear.Your father finally convinced him...that you had both the senseand the ability to be good.I will not disappoint him, Mama.It would be morethan a simple disappointment.A great futurehas been arranged for you.A great future?- What is it, Mama? Tell me.- You are going to be married.Married?- To whom?- Rupert zu Wigenstorf of Prussia.No!It'll be the marriage of two ofthe proudest names in Europe...cementing not only a personal alliance,but one between countries.- You will be an instrument of history.- Will I?"Two great states will be weldedtogether through you and Rupert."- Do you know who said that?- The Emperor?Those were his very words,spoken to your father only yesterday.- Where is Papa? Why is he not here?- He's at the palace, I suppose...on some tiresome matters of state.Congratulations.Now..."Miss Sonia Volenski."As a singer,a loyal subject of the Emperor..."for enrichingthe cultural life of the Empire..."for your service in the causeof our beloved opera..."for the many nights of pleasureyou have given His Imperial Majesty..."in the opera house..."it is my pleasure to confer upon you..."as Chief Steward toHis Imperial Majesty..."the Medal of Honour."Congratulations, madame."Herr Hyman Teperson."As the other bright lightof our beloved opera..."- Excuse me.- Your Highness.- What is it?- Your daughter has just arrived...and the Princess wishes to see you.If you'll excuse me, an urgent matter.But the honour is as great,no matter who pins it on.Will you take over, please? Sorry.Will you bring some tea, Maria?Now, the formal engagementwon't be announced for several days.Very delicate days, Olympia.Your behaviour must be flawless.Not a breath of scandal must touch you.Not a whisper.Papa!Welcome home.- I missed you.- And I missed you.How many times have I asked youto knock...before you enter my private apartment?- Darling, I'm your husband.- All the more reason.- Have you told her?- Yes, it's wonderful.Well, it's political, anyway.Prussia is very important to us.The Emperor is anxiousto strengthen our ties to them...in as many ways as possible.- But the final decision is up to you.- What a terrible thing to say.You sound likeone of those revolutionists.- She's not in love with Rupert.- What's that got to do with it?I was in love with you.Accidents can happen,but you can't count on them.I make the decisionto marry Rupert, Mama.Of course you do.Darling, now you've seen her,you go back the palace.Olympia and I have to go overthe invitations.Invitations for what?We're giving a party for Rupert.He's here in Vienna on a state visit.Nothing elaborate,200, 300 people at the most.I'll see you at dinner, Olympia.I'm glad to be home.Each time I see you, I thinkyou can't possibly get more beautiful.- And each time I'm wrong.- Thank you.I shall marry because I want to.I have a strong sense of duty to myself.You know, Olympia, sometimes I thinkyou are stronger than any of us.My daughter.- Philip!- Lina. Albert.Glad to see you. I have to go.Excuse me.Well?- There she is.- Who?The one danger we really have to face:Lina Schwarzenfeld.I knew it. She's home.It's the only reason he'd leavethe palace during the day.I think you're right.We'll have to move fast, Albert.Very fast.We will.Drive on.- Are she and Rupert still...- Have been for years.That's how her husband's managed tostay Ambassador to Berlin all this time.Lina will stop at nothingto keep you from marrying Rupert.That would be the end ofall her influence.You'll have to be careful, Olympia.Very, very careful.You must behave as ifthe cold blue eyes of the Emperor...were upon you every hourof the day and night.I will.I suppose we shall have to invite Linato the party.She's much too dangerous to slight.- Mama?- Yes, dear?Rupert isn't exactly clever, is he?He doesn't have to be, dear.He's a prince.Excuse me, sir. Can you tell meif it's all right to park here?I'm a stranger in town.I don't know your rules.You never will, but in this countryit's safer to assume...that if they don't exactly say you can,you're probably not allowed to.That doesn't seem right.With a system like that,you'd never make any progress.You'd just stand still.That's the whole idea.Is this machine French or English?- American. I brought it over with me.- American?I didn't know they were makingsuch beautiful cars in America.People around here don't seem to knowmuch about America.I guess the opportunitiesfor education must be pretty slim.Yes, very.My own class, for example,simply hasn't got the time for it.Well, it was nice meeting you.You can park anywhere.Thank you, sir.Your pass, sir.Letter of introduction fromthe Austrian Embassy in Washington...to the Lord High Steward,Prince Philip Ballastrem.Your Highness.An American gentlemanwishes to see you.No.I am very sorry.If you will be good enoughto leave this with me, Mr. Foster...I will see that it's calledto Prince Philip's personal attention.- You mean I can't see him today?- Impossible.That room is full of peoplewaiting to see him...including a British earland two Russian grand dukes...who have been here since Easter.- When can I get to see him?- Let me see.Today is Monday.Tomorrow we have the receptionat Prince Philip's house in the evening.Wednesday,the Prince goes to the Jockey Club.Thursday and Fridayare religious holidays.A reception at his house, huh?How about next week?Next week the whole court goes awayfor the summer.You'd better figure on late September,or perhaps early October, to be safe.- October? Why, that's ridiculous.- Of course, it is.Listen to this young man, Andrι.He has a fresh point of view.Yes, Prince Philip.- Is that Prince Philip?- Yes, it is.This is the list of the guestsfor tomorrow.- Excuse me, sir, but I have to see you.- Another time.Please.How about when he's finished working?Could I see him at home?Are you joking?You couldn't possibly get into his home.It's absolutely out of the question.Have to be a grand duketo get in there, too?Mr. Foster, you have to be something.I am something.Didn't you hear the Prince?I'm a fresh point of view.Only he doesn't know how fresh.I'll be seeing you.Hurry up, gentlemen. We are late.Hurry, gentlemen. Do hurry, please.Good evening, Herr Liebner.- Your Highness.- How's your orchestra?The finest, Your Highness.Every man a virtuoso.That's fine. You have a great reputation.You must deserve it.So delightful of you to come, darling.The Count and Countessvon Waltenbourg.Is everything here?Now, put it all on the table.And the lobster, there. Yes.Is the champagne ready? And the wine?Count Alexander Sandor of Mulgravia.Well, Your Excellencies,this seems quite a festive occasion.People have been asking for Olympia.Where is she?She's waiting until Rupert arrivesto make her entrance.Wait. Here comes Lina.Countess Lina. Count.She really should watch her figure,you know.She's coming outin the most vulgar places.No, you stay here.Lina.Darling, you look lovely. And so slim.- Albert, how are you?- I've had a little trouble with my liver.We were so thrilledto hear that Olympia was back.And the marvellous newsabout her and Rupert.Yes, dear,the Emperor couldn't be happier.If you will excuse me, I promisedmy wine steward a brief conference.We had a wine steward once.Gone with the cellar.Where is darling Olympia?We're dying to see her.She's in her room, darling.She's too shy to come outbefore Rupert arrives.Will you forgive me?Rupert will be here in a few minutes.Don't look so pleased with yourself.Hello. Would you give methe Maxim Cabaret?I want the dressing roomof Mademoiselle Yvette.Yes, Yvette.- Prince Philip?- Yes?I'm here to offer the Imperial Treasurya $1 million proposition.- $1 million?- Yes sir, that's why I'm here.I mean, that's why I crashed your party.You're a most extraordinary young man.Crashing a party like that.- Well, I'm sorry, sir, but...- I seem to run into you everywhere.I'd better explain. You see...I must say,I admire your enterprise, Mr...Foster, sir. Charles Foster.- Have a drink.- Thank you, sir.- To $1 million.- Yes sir, I'll drink to that.His Serene Highness,Prince Rupert zu Wigenstorf.- Princess Eugenie.- How do you do?Countess.It was so good of you to come.I was talking to your Aunt Gisellathe other day, such a sweet creature.Tell me, is that the onewho inherited part of Poland?Yes, and lost it at Monte Carlo.Well, I heard it wasn't the best part.And your cousins, how are they?Your Highness, may I presentmy husband, my daughter.Baroness.Charming to see you.Do have a lovely evening.- Your Highness...- The last time we met was at the races.Do you remember, Your Highness?Mr. Foster. The proposition.Yes, sir.Well, sir, it's this.- You know what bauxite is.- I do.It's a mineral.You make it into aluminium.I think you call it "aluminium."I know that.My company makes it,by the Hall-Heroult process...discovered simultaneously...by the American, Hall,and the Frenchman, Heroult.The discovery of this processmade possible...the cheap, practical productionof aluminium.I've heard about it. Very...Now, I don't have to tell you allthe things aluminium can be used for.- Of course not, but you will.- Yes, sir.Here she is.Prince Rupert.Perhaps Your Highnessmay recall the Princess Olympia.I recall a charming child.I see a woman of beauty.Your Highness.Before such beauty,it is I who must bow my head.I can't imagine where your father is.He was here a moment ago.I'll get him. I know where he is.In his study, hiding from the company.It's where he always goeswhen we have a party.- Will you excuse me?- Only for a moment.It will not be more.You have a beautiful daughter, madame.Well, we tried hard.But mark my words,the deposits in Dalmatia...these are the most importantbecause the great...Lucrezia.- Wrong number.- Hello, darling. This is Yvette.- I don't know what you're talking about.- Hello?What were you saying, Mr. Foster?Excuse me, sir.- Would you like to dance?- Olympia!I know I should wait to be asked.- Did you find your father?- Yes. No.- Would you like to dance?- I'd be delighted, Olympia.- Excuse me, I...- Hello.Excuse me, Your Highness,but the American is here.Yes, I know.If this marriage goes through,you will lose your job, you know.Rupert wouldn't desert us, would he,after all these years?Look at her againand answer your own question.He would, wouldn't he?I think this dance is mine.Why, yes, so it is.Will you excuse me, Your Highness?All right, you found me.Have you told my father?Your father?Prince Philip. Does he know about us?- Is Prince Philip your father?- Didn't you know?All I know is I came hereto talk business with him.- Then you walked in and I...- Good.Then there is still time.Philip, who is that young man?- An American.- An American?With $1 million in aluminium.- How did he get in here?- I never had a chance to ask him.Do me a favour.Dance toward the corridor, will you?She's lovely, isn't she?It's a pity her looksaren't matched by her virtue.- Really?- Yes.She's considered quite wild, you know.And you always did likethe sort you could trust, didn't you?- Why did you disappear?- Because I thought it was better.Look, I don't understand any of this.But I was desperate that morningwhen I couldn't find you.I ran all over the placetrying to catch up to you.I thought losing you was the worst thingthat ever happened to me.You see, sometimes inthe emotional stress of a moment...we think something is true that really...Only the difference is,now I know it's true.I'm not going to let it happen againnow that I've found you.- You have not found me.- You're here, Lucrezia.My name is Olympia Louisa Elizabeth,nιe Ballastrem.Whatever your name is, it's still you.I cannot explain now.Will you please leave?- All right, then meet me tomorrow.- Not tomorrow, not ever.- Are you married?- I'm not married, but...- Then there's no real reason why...- It is impossible.That's what they saidabout seeing your father.One of your favourite wordsaround here.I cannot remain here another second.- Will you please go?- No.I don't really think you want me to leave.I'm sorry.You leave me only one choice.Yes, Your Highness.This gentleman wishes to leave.Will you escort him to the door?- Now, wait a minute. Just because...- This way, sir.Albert, go and find that manand tell me who he is.- How?- Have him followed, you idiot.Over here, Mr. Foster.- Countess Schwarzenfeld?- Yes. Won't you sit down?There's really no mystery.I telephoned you to meet me here...because I saw youat the party last night.And you looked so lost.- And then when you left so hurriedly...- I still don't see why...It's simply impossible for a strangerto get anywhere in Viennese society...without a sponsor.- So my husband and I felt that possibly...- You have a husband?One does, you know.That's what last night was about.Getting one for Olympia.- The Princess.- Didn't you know?Her family want to marry her to Rupert.Is she in love with him?What an adorable question, Mr. Foster.This is a marriage, not a love affair.I don't think their feelingsenter into it one way or the other.Tomorrow there's a horse showat the Riding Club.Let me explain, Countess.I'm not interested in getting into society.I'm here on business, andI have appointments all day tomorrow.How unfortunate.And with Olympia competingfor the Grand Cup.But, of course,if you have engagements...I can cancel them.After all, it's only business.It will really be a pleasureto sponsor you, Mr. Foster.Miss Olympia Thor-Felsenegghas completed this round...with no penalties or faults.Next entry is Sea Breeze,ridden by Captain Carl Lutenfeld.Count Sandor,how good of you to come.Your invitations always intrigue me,Countess Lina.- Whose reputation are you after now?- Don't be so suspicious.I want you to meeta young American friend.- Sandor, of Mulgravia.- Foster, of Pennsylvania.You must excuse me, Mr. Foster.It is my duty to be suspicious.Why? Are you a policeman?As the Emperor's personal equerry...I report to His Majesty all breachesof the protocol...if members of the courtdon't behave as they should.So, in a way, I am a kind of policeman.Next entry is Frenesee,ridden by Franz Denault...of the First Vienna Cavalry Regiment.Have you been a long time in Vienna,Mr. Foster?Just a few days.- Did you pass through Morau?- Yes, I think I did.Isn't this the placewhere the Thor-Felsenegg castle is?- Whose castle?- Olympia's former husband.Dead now, poor thing.Olympia spent her exile at Morau,you know.You did stop there,didn't you, Mr. Foster?I stopped near there.Does that meanyou know Princess Olympia?Didn't you see Mr. Fosterdancing with her at the party?- That was you?- Yes. I met her there.- For the first time.- Really?You looked like such good friends.You can't tell who's friendlyjust by looking at them, Countess.I've found that out in my position.Come, everyone, before the last jump.We must pay our respectsto Prince Rupert.As you have seen, Frenesee,with two poles down...will receive eight penalty faults.Coming up now, for the final roundof our competition is Ecstasy...ridden byPrincess Olympia Thor-Felsenegg.Ladies and gentlemen,announcing the award...for the open championshipjumping class...the winner is Ecstasy, ridden byPrincess Olympia Thor-Felsenegg.You. Everywhere, you.- What have you told Lina?- She's out for blood, isn't she?What did you tell her?- How about going out with me?- You haven't answered my question.I have a few of my own to ask you first.I've learned not to trust you.- Listen, I've got to see you.- Very well, then.Meet me at the Chalet Anglaiseby the University corner at 11:00.All right, I'll see you there.Your Highness.A magnificent performance.May I be permitted to attend the partycelebrating your victory?I'll be delightedto be with Your Highness until 10:00.My mother is quite strict.Congratulations, Princess.Where shall we go?Let's go somewherewhere nobody can possibly see us.That's all right with me. Let's go.You sure have a funny wayof not being seen.The way not to be seen in Vienna,is to go to a public place...that is never patronisedby your own friends.You mean these peoplearen't really seeing you?I mean they don't count.I should warn you about our May wine.It seems gentle, but it's very strong.- It can go to your head.- Maybe it'll go to both our heads.And then?I might get another glimpseof the girl who wore my pyjamas.The warning doesn't apply to me.I'm used to our wine.Waiter.- Is our table ready?- Yes, sir.This way, please.At least you're friendlierthan you were the other night.- You weren't exactly hospitable.- I couldn't be.That night we had to spendout in the country...you were as warm and friendlyas anyone could wish.You think so? Was I really that friendly?Yes.I've never felt like that about a girl,and so quickly.- You were wonderful.- It's nice of you to say so.I couldn't remember all the detailstoo well in the morning.- What did I do that was so wonderful?- Everything.Everything?I mean, you were just perfect.I'll never forget that night.There's a good reasonthat your memory is clearer than mine.- You drugged me.- Accidentally.What I'm trying to say is...you did feel something, there with me.And what I'm trying to sayis that I don't remember.Perhaps I did feel something.- But now it's all gone?- I didn't say that.I might find you extremely attractive.It might be very exciting to be with youat this moment, but...But?They are only feelings.They train you in a rough school.I'm trained for the roleto which I was born.And this marriage you're planning?It's being arranged for you?According to custom.You really thinkyou can live without love?Certainly not. What a ridiculous idea.Then you do carefor this Prince Rupert?I scarcely know him.You're getting me mixed up.It's quite simple, Mr. Foster.I like to listen to music.What does that have to do with it?It doesn't meanI have to marry a musician.Now, would you do me a favour?Would you ask the band to playmy favourite song, A Breath of Scandal?- Are you trying to get rid of me?- For the moment.Because of feelingsthat aren't supposed to matter?Maybe.- Will you be here when I get back?- Yes. This time.Would you playA Breath of Scandal for me?- Yes, sir.- Thank you.Pleasure, sir.Excuse me.Prince Philip?Oh, no, Mr. Foster.I'm an amiable man,but this I will not permit.Some places I must not be followed.I didn't follow you.10:00, tomorrow morning, at my house.- I beg your pardon?- We can continue our discussion then.- Please, Mr. Foster. Will you...- Excuse me.- Who's that?- Never mind.Will you have a bonbon?I thought this time you had gone away.No. Listen,I think we better get out of here.But I want to hear the song.We can go somewhere else and hear it.There is nowhere else.Why do you want to leave?- It's hot in here.- You have been drinking too much.That's it. I never could hold my liquor.- Just sit back and relax.- No, I need some air.And in memory I am dancing toA tune and a rhyme- Why, that's...- Yes, it's a very catchy tune, isn't it?That's my father.- He mustn't see me here.- He mustn't see you?Of course not. It would be terrible.- Who is he with?- With?With nobody. He's all by himself.Not with a girl?No, he's not exactly with her.She's on the other side of the table.What are you going to tell your mother?I'm certainly not going to tell herI was here.I mean, about him?She knows he's somewhere like this.It's Thursday night.Shall we go?This way.A tune and a rhymein three-quarter timein old ViennaA touch in the air of devil-may-careAh, that was the old ViennaThe light of a candleThe breath of a scandalI was so in love with ViennaNow each lover's laneReminds me in vainOf love songs that we have sungOh, it's no wonder I sighFor moments gone byWhen Vienna and I were youngYou know what time it is in Pittsburghright now?6:00. Still daylight.Will I see you tomorrow?- When?- I'll let you know.A tune and a rhymein three-quarter timeThat was the old ViennaA touch in the air of devil-may-careThat was the old ViennaThe light of a candleThe breath of a scandalI was so in love with ViennaNow each lover's laneReminds me in vainOf love songs that we have sungOh, it's no wonder I sighFor moments gone byWhen Vienna and I were young- I thank you very much.- No, I thank you.- Here is your Yvette.- Thank you.She's a charming girl.Goodbye.- Olympia!- Yes, Mama.I saw youwhen you came home last night.So that's why you wantedto see me before noon.You know we can't afford any scandal.Once scandal spreads,there's no way to stop it.I remember when some nonsenseabout me and Baron Krovath...It was like an epidemic.What about you and Baron Krovath?Well, it was one night,I remember, that... Never mind!The point is you're already a suspectin the Emperor's eyes.Those cold blue eyes.And Lina's ready to run to the palace...with any titbitshe can get her teeth into.What do you want me to do?First, if it's not too personalfor a mother to ask...what happened between youand that man?- Nothing.- What I saw was far from nothing.Whatever did happen,it's nothing to me.That's what you want me to say, isn't it?- Is he in love with you?- Yes.- How do you feel about him?- Does it matter?That depends on whetheryou still want to marry Rupert.I do.Then you must actaccording to your birth and breeding.You must have the strength to smotheryour feelings, whatever they are.- I have the strength.- To send him away? Openly?Honestly, and forever?Cut him off completely,without a hope to cling to?It's your only course, Olympia,do know that.- Can you do it?- Yes.- Now. Before he leaves this house.- Why? Is he here?With your father,on some business or other.Will it be hard for you?Yes.You won't falter?No.If you'll let me give you some advicefrom my own experience...man is a noble animal.Don't wound him, kill him.One word is enoughif it goes straight to the heart.Very well.I'd better get dressed in somethingmore suitable for an execution.I think your project has merit,Mr. Foster...but, of course, the decisionwill be made by the Emperor.And I must warn you, it may take time.There are still proposals left overfrom the last reign...to which His Majestyhas not given attention yet.- And he has been Emperor for 61 years.- 61 years.If the customs of your countryare different, I can wait.Mr. Foster, you seemed to bein such a hurry before.I believe in facing facts, sir.If it can't be done quickly,I'll just have to make the best of it.You have the pleased air of a man...who has already found somethingto make the best of.And I don't think it concerns aluminium.No, sir, it doesn't.Well, Mr. Foster...I will present your proposal tothe Emperor with my recommendations.- I'm very grateful, sir.- I'm not doing it for you, Mr. Foster.We could use a little of the 20th centuryin our country.Excuse me.My daughter would like to see youbefore you leave.She wants you to wait for herin the summer house.- I think you'll find it easily.- Yes, sir.That seems to be your patternaround here, Mr. Foster.First me, then Olympia.I want to explainabout the other night, sir.Don't bother, Mr. Foster.Just go to my daughter.I'm used to seeing menbehaving around her...as if they had lost their minds.Yes, sir.Darling.Did you finish your businesswith my father?Yes, and I thinkit's going to work out, too.I wanted to talk to you about last night.I couldn't sleep, I felt so good.I just lay there thinking.I haven't done thatsince I was 16 years old.What were youthinking about? Marriage?That was one of the things.I guess I think just like a peasant.Do you really think thatI would marry you?I love you, and you love me.- Even if I did.- What do you mean, even?Say, what's the matter with you?I know. You told your mother,and she's mad.- I'll talk to her.- You will not talk to anyone.Not to my mother, not to my father.And, after today, not to me.What are you trying to do?I am killing my interest in you,before it gets too strong.Then you do care for me.- I'm attracted to you.- And that's all?Even that is too much. It means nothingand can lead to nothing.You didn't act that way last night.Last night we had too much music.What did we have in the hunting lodge?Did you knowwhose hunting lodge that was?Mine.Did you think I was really hurt?I was playing with you becauseI was bored. It amused me.I am no longer amused, andI don't like games that become serious.- Now you bore me.- I don't believe you.Because you are a fool.Even that was part of your attraction.The way my ancestorsused to be entertained by their fools.But I thought about you last night,and you became suddenly tiresome.So you used meto break your monotony.What if I did?I could be capable of anything,but not what you want.I wanted you for the rest my life.Find yourself someoneon your own level.You've had your dream, now it's over.There's the gate.- I don't know why you're doing this.- Because I want to.Don't ever think otherwise.Now, will you go,or must I call the servants again?No, don't bother. I'll go.Well? You've seen him?Yes.- You killed him.- Yes.Of course, if telling me about itwould help you at all...Was it so painful?Frightfully.Then you must have been really cruel.I was.I'm proud of you, Olympia.Come in.Count Sandor, Your Highness.- To see me?- Yes, madam.He must be coming to discussthe formal announcement...of your engagement.- Show him in.- You see him alone, Mama. I can't now.Or this is the work of Lina.Telling stories about youand the American.Olympia, were you indiscreet?- Yes, I think so.- What do you mean, you think so?Either you were or you were not.However, this is no time for details.But just tell me, would the truthdamage the family name?Yes.Then we've only one honourable course.We must lie...gallantly, with our heads erect.How fortunateto find both Your Highnesses together.Princess Eugenie. Princess Olympia.Count Sandor,what a delightful surprise.A surprise, perhaps, but not delightful.It is my unfortunate duty to putcertain questions to Your Highnesses.Questions?They concern an American gentleman...Mr. Charles Foster.Mr. Foster attended the partyin this house the other night.Gaining his entrance through some low,American trick.Then why did he choose to insinuatehimself in this particular house?It seems he hadsome matter of business...he wanted to discuss with my father.There was no other reason?No previous encounterbetween him and Your Highness?But of course not.I refer to your daughter's recent stayat the castle of her late husband.I have information that Mr. Foster...travelled through that partof the country.Well, so do many foreigners.Then you didn't happento meet him there?I did not.I have information here, indicating...where Princess Olympiaand this gentleman...have been seen together.Lina. Dear Lina.Are you sure there's nothing furtherin connection with this matter...that Your Highnesses feel thatHis Majesty, the Emperor, should know?There was nothing to concernHis Imperial Majesty...and there will be nothing.It has been made emphatically plainto Mr. Foster...that he is not to botherthis household again.I thank you.Please forgive the embarrassmentI may have caused Your Highnesses...in the performance of my duty.We quite understand, Count Sandor.You must be relieved to havethis ridiculous investigation over.Unfortunately, it is not over yet,Princess Eugenie.- Mama.- I heard him.- He's not finished with us.- He's going on to the American next.- Oh, no!- Oh, yes!I can see the look in his eye.Now, what would the American say?How should I know? He hates me now.- There must be a way out.- Of course there is.- We can take poison.- Mama.Not a fatal dose, of course,but just enough to show remorse.If the American does talk,would it be truly terrible?The end.You said there wasnothing between you.Well...- Nothing.- Nothing?But how much nothing?- Well...- No, I don't want to know.We must throw ourselveson Mr. Foster's mercy.I'll ask him to come here at once.You go and change your dress.At a time like this,you talk about clothes?There's no successful strategywithout tactics.What you wore when you saw himthis morning is all wrong now.You need somethinga little more alluring.- Now run along.- All right.Now, telephone.- Mr. Foster?- How did you know where to find me?Princess Olympia saidyou might be here.For you, sir.What do you know?They must want something pretty bad.- Am I supposed to go with you?- Yes, sir.I wouldn't miss thisfor anything in the world.Mr. Foster,we've never really been introduced.But this is not a moment for etiquette.It's not?It is a moment to be directand absolutely frank.It is?I assume that in Americathere is such a thing as honour.Don't be too sure. On our level,we don't go in for honour very much.Well, Mr. Foster, to a familysuch as ours, honour is everything.Today, that honour is in dangerof being compromised.- You alone can save it.- Me?You.That's quite a privilege, ma'am.Men have diedfor that privilege, Mr. Foster.Really? How?I mean, how can I save it,not how did they die.You will be questionedabout how you met my daughter.Oh, that.When that happens, what will you say?I don't know. I hadn't thought about it.Who's going to ask me?- A representative of His Majesty.- The Emperor?When I speak to this person, it'll belike speaking to the Emperor himself?- Exactly.- Then I don't have any choice, do I?What do you mean?The Emperor, what is it they call him?"The First Gentleman of Europe."I couldn't tell him anythingbut the truth, could I?Olympia, Mr. Foster is entirely right.To think of lying to the Emperoris beyond belief.I must revise my estimate of America,young man.Don't go too far.Of course, you could leave Vienna,thus avoiding the issue entirely.That's out of the question.- So it's blackmail. Let us come to terms.- That could be done.Olympia, fetch my jewel case.- I'm not interested in jewellery.- Very well, then. Money.- How much?- Nor money.What do you want, then?Your company, for the weekend.Olympia, violence will get us nowhere.Everything we have in the worldis at stake now.We must act quickly and decisively.- What do you mean by act?- I'm in no mood for explanations.How long did you say?A weekend.- And then it would be over?- Forever.Immediate disappearanceand everlasting silence.Mama, what...- Mama?- The choice is up to you.If you choose public scandaland disgrace, I shall stand by you...and so will your father. Your poor father.But it's for you to choose.I hope you will not hesitate.Ballastrems never do.They may die, but they do not hesitate.How would you choose, if you were me?How can I say? He hasn't asked me.But if he did, I wouldn't hesitate.Say, I'm sorry.I hope I didn't hurt your feelings, ma'am.- Where would you take me?- I know just the place.Perhaps I'd better leavethe two of you alone. It might be easier.- Call me if you need me, dear.- Yes.Although, unfortunately,this is not one of those situations...that permit the motherto sacrifice herself.- You've decided, haven't you?- Yes.In favour of honour.- I don't expect you to understand.- You never do.Yes, I've decided in favour of honour...unless you have in your black heartsome touch of pity.Why is this any more terrible for youthan what you planned that first night?Because this I did not plan...and because you're imposing your willon me by force.I won't use any more forcethan is absolutely necessary.- Can I help you?- I can manage, thank you.The old place hasn't changedvery much. Can I help you?I can manage very well, thank you.You could make this whole thingmore pleasant...if you didn't act like such a martyr.I have no interestin making this pleasant.And I am a martyr.And you intend to suffer like one.I better build a fire.Looks like it's going to bea cold weekend.No, I've already said I'll seeto the Princess's meals myself.- Who has the measles?- Olympia, poor child.They came on suddenly,without any warning.- Have I had them?- Yes, when you were 6 years old.I remember your dear mothertelling me about it.- Then I can go up and see her.- No. The doctor said no visitors.Is it serious?No, he wants her to rest.I'm only allowed in to bring her meals.Now, don't worry, darling.In two or three days Olympiais going to be perfectly well again.Now, run along, darling.- Yes. Goodbye.- Goodbye.Measles!You should have had some of this ham.It was delicious.You ate it all.So I did. I have to keep up my strength.You tired?I have no personal feelings.I am what you will.All right then, you're tired.Besides, it's getting late.You bring a nightgown this time?I have a collection in my bedroom.Good.I prefer to wear my pyjamas myself.I think you know the way. It's over there.Come in.The reading material around hereis rather limited.You might enjoy this."Mating Habits of Austrian Birds."Eugenie, I came as soon as I heardthe dear child was ill.Darling, how sweet of you.Olympia's favourite flowers.- No.- No.- There.- There.- Lina!- Philip!I was so sorryto hear about poor Olympia.But I thoughtyou couldn't get measles twice.- Olympia's never had them before.- But of course she has, darling.- That summer in Salzburg.- No, dear.- But Dr. Lesselbaum remembered.- You've seen Dr. Lesselbaum?It was such a coincidencebumping into him this morning.He did treat Olympia that summer,didn't he, darling?- That's right, he did.- For measles.When, in point of fact,Olympia had mumps.Lesselbaum treated her for measleswhen she had mumps?One is nothing like the other, darling.Dr. Lesselbaum has never been notedfor his skill at diagnosis.Lesselbaum?There is a growing suspicionthat he is not a doctor at all.Dr. Lesselbaum treats the royal family.And have you never wonderedwhy so many of them die young?Lina, you've been an absolute angel.You'll be the first to knowwhen Olympia can have visitors.I do hope there are no complications.There won't be darling,not if I can help it.Lesselbaum.I wouldn't have believed it.Why did you do what you did last night?You mean...why didn't I do what I didn't do?- Yes.- Does it matter?No. I was foolish to ask.- Are you in this picture?- Yes.Who are the rest of the people?The Imperial family. Friends.Who's the young man behind you?The one with the nice face.The Crown Prince.The one who shot himself and that girl?Yes.He made a sacrifice, too, didn't he?Just like you.Only he didn't do it for family name.He did it for love.You wouldn't do that though, would you?Only for position.Your position in the Court ofFranz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria...King of Hungary, of Croatia, Bohemia,and Lord knows how many other places.But is that what you really want?To be a name, a title?Or do you wantwhat I can give you as a man?You are not a man to me.Think you can say that when I hold you?Don't touch me.I'm sorry.I must pay my debt.I am at your disposal, day and night.Not anymore, you're not.I'm releasing you.- What do you mean?- I mean you don't have to pay your debt.It's cancelled.You're telling me I'm free to go?Yes, and you needn't worry.I'll keep my part of the bargain.I won't talk, and I'll get out of town.Why are you doing this?You wouldn't understand.I tried to get even...but I'm in love with you. It wouldn't work.I am no longer in your power?That's right.In that case...I am willing to stay...if you are.Do you really mean that?We still have half our weekend left.- Darling, you do care.- I care very much.Charlie.Your pride, your sweet, lovely pride.It wouldn't let you give in...- as long as I had the upper hand.- Of course.I love you with all my heart.I love you in all the familiar waysit's ever been said.And I love you, my Charlie.It's so good to be able to say it.- How long have you known?- For sure?I'd say outside my front door, whenyou brought me home from Maxim's.- I thought so then.- But when I loved you most...was when I had to sayall those awful things to you yesterday.This is forever, isn't it?I know it is with me.With me, too.I can see us when we are very, very old.Tottering into each other's arms.It's our fate.We couldn't escape it if we wanted to.You must havetwo of your aluminium plants.One in Berlin and one in Vienna.- Why Berlin?- Rupert is a Prussian prince.I must assume in lifethe station I was meant for.You mean...I'd just be your...What you are and always will be.My own true love.Get your things.I'm taking you back to Vienna.- But, Charlie...- I'll get the car ready.- This way, Doctor.- Thank you.Prince Philip.- Princess Eugenie.- Count Sandor.Madame.Dr. Lesselbaum.I have been informed that Olympiadoes not have the measles at all.As a matter of fact,she may not even be in this house.Where would she be?My daughter is lying ill in her room,forbidden to see anyone.- By whom?- Her doctor.- Whose name is?- Doctor Hermann Sackadorf.- But that's not our doctor.- He's a specialist in measles.He's in Budapest now,stopping an epidemic of them.In this case, you must give permissionto Dr. Lesselbaum...- the Court physician, to take charge.- No. Never!Come here.- What's all this?- I give you my word.Maybe if they just lookedin from the door.The very sight of this manwill give her convulsions.She remembers his treatment of her.- I'm sorry, Princess, I must insist.- The Emperor shall hear of this.I gave you the word of a Ballastrem.Unbroken in 600 years.Olympia!Madame!Dr. Lesselbaum, in this caseI think we'd better leave.Madame.Something tells mewe're going to hear from the Emperor."In the course of the investigationpresently being conducted..."certain facts have come to light..."which will requirefurther testimony by you..."and you are therefore summonedto appear at Schoenbrunn Palace..."at 10:00 on the morning of June 21..."where at such timeyou will be received..."into the presence ofHis Imperial Majesty."We should both have taken poison.You're shivering, my dear.Is there a draft?It's those icy blue eyes.I can feel them right through the door.- What does he want to see her for?- I shudder to think.I know what I'd do in his place.Have her strangled, slowly.Or dipped in boiling oil.For some things,the old ways were really the best.Excuse me, Your Highness.The American is waiting in your office.Excuse me.- Mama?- Yes, dear?If the Emperor knowsI went away with Mr. Foster...- he'll think I...- Of course, dear.Like anyone else would think that you...As a matter of fact,it's not my business...but he actually did let you go without...I told you he did.Yes, I know, dear,but it does seem a bit unnatural.Not for him.Mr. Foster, the news I have for youis not entirely good.- You mean I don't get the concession?- Not this year.The Emperor leaves todayfor the summer at Bad Ischl...and he still hasa roomful of people to see.- However...- Never mind the "howevers," sir.If I'm turned down, I'm turned down.However, His Imperial Majestyhas authorised me...to bestow upon youthe Order of Aspern, Second Class.The what?The Order of Aspern, Second Class.- What am I supposed to do with that?- Wear it, of course.On state occasions in America.- State occasions?- Naturally.Would you be good enoughto complete the citation?I may be called at any moment.But don't worry, Mr. Foster.The honour is the same,no matter who pins it on.Here.A pleasant journey, Mr. Foster.I'm sorry.Just getting out of this crazy countrywill be a pleasure.- Well?- He treated me disgracefully.- But why?- I don't know.The whole thing's too ridiculousfor words. I've never been so insulted.Princess Olympia Thor-Felsenegg,nιe Ballastrem.Well, darling.And how is His Majesty this morning?Charming, of course. Full of thoseold-fashioned compliments.He was friendly to you?Darling, I've known himsince he was 65.He didn't keep you very long.Simply because he had to seeeveryone today.Where is he sending you this time?Olympia, speak to me.It's your mama.- He forgave me.- Oh, my heart.Everything is like it was.I can marry Rupert.Prince Rupert, Your Majesty.Did you hear?- It's simply wonderful.- Yes.Did you hear, Lina?It's simply wonderful.Now you have your dream.Will you be happy?I will meet my responsibilities.They may be grave ones.To be a Prussian wife,that won't be easy for you.If I may ask,did you fall in love with the American?Yes.And you are able to chooseagainst love?Why not?I'm a Ballastrem as much as you are.Me? What do I have to do with it?You have mistresses.That girl from the can-can.It's not funny. She's younger than I am.What is funny is that she is my mistressfor appearance's sake only.Appearance.Just to preserve my social standing.But do you knowwhose girl she really is?Andrι, my aide's.I give her dinner every Thursday nightand then deliver her to him, so...I will now shock you even more.Your mother and I have been faithfulto each other...for 36 years.Now, this must remain a family secret.People would thinkwe were undermining the government.But you see, your mother and I...have always been in love.You could afford to be.You were a princeand she was a princess.You didn't have to make a choice.But love is always choice,don't you know that?Hour by hour, day by day...either you choose love, or you don't.Suppose I did choose the other way?- For love.- Now?Disobey the Emperor's command?What would happen if I did?You would have to get the fastest caryou could find...and be across the borderbefore he heard about it.And you?Would you be in trouble?The whole Empire is in trouble.There is no sure future for any of us.Goodbye, Father.- I'll have to run.- Goodbye, my Olympia.You will find Americaa most peculiar place.Everyone thinkshe's equal to everyone else.They even write it into their laws.I love you.Of course you do, darling.I'm your mama.- Explain to Rupert.- Explain?- Explain what? Where is she going?- I'm afraid, to America.America?His Imperial Majesty.Charlie!- Are you hurt?- I don't think so.But you'd better carry me.Where to?Is Pittsburgh too far?
