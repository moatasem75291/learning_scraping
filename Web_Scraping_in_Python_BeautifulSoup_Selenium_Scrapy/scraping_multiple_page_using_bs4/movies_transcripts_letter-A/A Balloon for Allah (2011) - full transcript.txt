            SUBTITLE TRACK FROM ITUNES (moviesbyrizzo uploads)My grandmother told me that I shouldalways look for the emerald.Islam was her emerald.Justice, love and unity.She told me that the falsifiedprophetic statements in Islam, -- the strict Shariah lawsand macho Imams, -- had swallowed the lightfrom the emerald.Only when all these are removed,will the emerald start to shine again, -- and women's suffering will cease.Grandma was so lucky.She was free to saywhat she meant.



I am not free.When I criticize Islamin the Muslim world, -- I'm considered reform-mindedand progressive.When I criticize Islam in the West,my words will be used by -- anti-immigrant andanti-Muslim groups.I am fed up with livingin such a prison.He won't meet usif we don't cover our hair.He wants no perfume or makeup.He even suggested niqabs.I will be visiting a young Salafist,Sheikh Mahmoud Mekki, in Cairo.His Islam is the exact oppositeof my grandmother's.Let's try and go inside.The Salafists view themselves as theonly correct interpreters of the Quran.For them, all moderateMuslims are almost heretics.The reason I agreed to this interview,



- was that it might be beneficialfor people outside the Arab world.Otherwise I would have insisted on having amale photographer or director.How many times have you hada female photographer film you?-Never.-Okay.-I'm the first one?-Yes.I want to tell you something: my wife,during our six years of marriage,- has never once left thehouse to go shopping.I do the shopping. She never goes out, exceptonce every three or four months, with me.She's happy? And you're happy?-Yes.-Okay.Oh, it's strawberry?I will learn Arabic. I will.-Insha'Allah-That's good.If I came here withoutwearing a hijab...Do you think you'd havetreated me differently?I am the same person.I have the same smile. So do you.And we share the same religion.Even I, a Sheikh, if a womancomes to me unveiled,- I will have desire for her.This is my nature as a man.If a woman wearing an Islamic dress,- with her face, hair and bodyveiled, walks in front of a man,- while another woman passesperfumed, wearing modern clothes,- revealing parts of her hair and body,- which one of the two would excite theman and tempt him into committing rape?So what if the man has nothing to...He's not going to rape any of them,because he's a good human being.In that sense, I'm unsurewhat you're talking about.You are denying man's naturalinstinct to desire women.You can't understand this fromyour female point of view,- whereas I can understand itbecause I am a man.Gamal Al Banna also lives in Cairo.He has been a target of Islamic extremists,because of his progressive ideas.He is now 90 years old.He has lived with constantdeath threats for several years.His courage gives me hope.His perspective helps me in myquest for the emerald I'm seeking.The woman issue needs a real revolution -- within the backward Islamicthought, which is far away -- from the texts of the Quran, its spirit andthe spirit of Islam in general.It is difficult for Europeans, whetherright or left, to understand Islam,- because they can only judge itby one of two things:Either by Muslims and their actions,or by the ideas of religious scholars.Those are the Europeans' references.Muslims' situation is shit, just asthe German convert said:I thank God that I became a Muslimbefore I saw Muslims."The Islamic scholars' views are in fact against Islam.As I said before, therecame a time when -- falsifying Hadiths (the Prophet's sayings),was considered a necessity -- and even a virtue. And all the details(of Shariah) come from the Hadiths,- as there are no details in the Quran itself.The Quranic text came down for apurpose. This purpose is justice.So if evolution has made this textunable to achieve justice anymore,- then we have to change it.Because the fundament isthe goal of the text, not its letters.Family mysteries have alwayscaught my attention.Gamal's older brother, Hassan Al Banna,was the founder of the Muslim Brothers, -- and a leading inspirational force behindtoday's Islamic fundamentalism.How come these brothers havechosen two so very different Islam?I wonder if Europeans can understandthe various faces of Islam, at all?Last night I had a strange dream.In the dream I sent a balloon toAllah, and put all my wonder into it.Suddenly I saw a tent thatlooked like the Sufi tent -- in my grandmother's stories.Everything was there.The past, the present and the future.I had to find an emerald that couldbring a new light to us women.I was free to go wherever I wanted.No one asked me if I had a validresidence permit or a valid passport.There I saw our origins, Adam and Eve.Playful, joyful and erotic.I also wanted to join them.Time almost stood still.Eve took an apple, and asked me:What is your religion?Why didn't I tell Eve that I'm Muslim?What kept me silent?Somehow, I had lost my language.I am a filmmaker with an accent,living in-betweenness;Europe, Asia, Asia, Europe.I live with images and dreams, whichbelong to two different continents, -- and I tell stories in several brokenhybrid languages.Don't let them build their houseson the mountain tops."Don't let them send theirdaughters to the far-away land."- Women are oppressed!- Even if you sing: "don't let themharass mother's precious daughter",- you don't hesitate to beat your beloved.They say that's what it says in the Quran.- Honestly, mom, I don't know which storyI'm going to choose in this film,- because it's a very complex subject.Your choice is different from mine,- the woman wearing hijab has madeanother choice, but all of us share the same goal;A better and more dignified life.And what do we need to make our lives better?- I have to find out.- All of us need to and have the right to be happy.- Yes.- Of course, without stepping on anyone's toes.- There is something I don't understand.- What's that, Nefise?- Why didn't you wish for a daughter?I mean, why did you always wish for a son?And then I showed up!- I wanted a boy because I knew howgirls are oppressed in our society.I thought of the social oppression towardswomen, psychologically as well.And I thought that a daughter wouldbe exposed to all of that,- whereas a son would have no problems.Look at our five fingers.They are very important.- I have five pieces of advice for you.- Okay, tell me.- #1 is to educate woman,- and let her stand on her own feet,- and understand herself better.#2; let her make her own decisionin marriage. If it fails,- she should not be humiliated.- Okay.- #3; regarding inheritance,- daughters and sons shouldhave equal rights.#4 is women's career and work situation.Women should have wage equality,and should not be harassed at work.You know, the most important thing for me?The most horrible of all?- What?- Domestic violence.- What kind of life have you had?- My life?- Let's talk about it.- Let's talk about it.That's private.My life? Let me tell you...I was never oppressed by my family.What have I done? I finished my education.I went to medical school, to be a doctor.I decided my marriage freely, and I alsodivorced by my own choice.- And then?- I remarried and started a new family.- I was never oppressed!- Okay, but did you have a happy life?I think of my dream.How can I find the emerald that canalleviate women's sufferings?I travel from my biological motherto my literary mother, -- the Egyptian feminist, psychiatristand novelist, Nawal El Saadawi.To walk with her in the streetsof Cairo, just after her final exile, -- is an art in and of itself.Everyone knows who she is.Several times I had to clarify to the policewhy I had a film camera with me.I said I made a movie about balloons.It was okay.Nawal El Saadawi is the queen of theprogressives, and one of the -- main opponents to theIslamic extremists.She was one of the firstwho took up the theme -- of women, sex and oppressionin the Muslim world.She knows the bitter tasteof prison and exile.Last year I met her in the literaturefestival in Molde.There, I had the opportunity to read outa letter I had written to her.I don't know how to begin. I'm one ofyour daughters you haven't met yet.Your work has influenced mefor many, many years.The core of my work has never beenbased on hate against religiosity, -- but based on a great willto change, interpret, -- create, repair and inherit.Which way shall I go, Nawal?Which fights will be my priority?Do I need to have a religious,sexual and cultural identity?What if my identity becomes a hinder?I'll put all my balloonsall around Cairo.-And I'll follow it to Turkey...-And Norway.I wrote a letter to Godwhen I was a child.-I didn't know where to send it.-Maybe I know.-You know his fax?-I read it in your play.But I can't send a fax.I have to send an e-mail.Maybe he doesn't have e-mail.We need to in factgo to the root of the problem.How do you go to the root?By asking questions.What do you mean by that?When a boy in his childhoodlearns at school -- that he's better than his sister, -- that he shall inheritthe double of her, -- that she should be veiled,and not he, and all that, -- his conscience is killed.His sense of justice is killed.So that's the problem.I want real secularism.I need a secular lawand value system.I don't want a family lawbased on religion.It must be secular.It's religious in Egypt.It's religious in many countries.So your daughter and sonwill inherit differently?According to the law, yes.Unless I change it myself.And before I die, I divide my moneyequally, and that's what I did.-So you can do that?-I did it in my lifetime.Because I'm free. I own my money.So I told my daughter and my sonthey'd both get an equal share.I've done it in my lifetime.But if I die, the government -- will give my daughterhalf of what my son gets.Because when you ask mewhether Islam allows feminism, -- then I have to knowwhat you mean by both.Because everybody hasa definition of feminism.There are many forms of feminism,of Islam, Christianity and Judaism.Every country,every group, interprets -- religion, feminism and humanismaccording to their own interests.If men are going to have this,I want to have it too.I don't want to have this one. I wantto have the same. Feminism is justice.And what is Islam to you?That's...Islam is...I can't say it's justice.I'm more attached to Muslim culturethan to Christian culture.Though I live in a Christian country,have a Christian husband, my kids...-You're married to a Christian?-A Norwegian man.And the thing is...I'm very attached to Sufism, andI'm really attached to spirituality.And I feel like my existence...I feel like my existenceis related to others.-I need you to be myself.-Exactly. That is creativity.So as I told you, you know,the existence in the culture -- where I grew up...I don't need to say who I am.Because we have so manyhidden things that we can say.So many small wordswe can use to in a way -- tell our hidden storiesto each other.That's why your mother was unhappy.My mother died young.She was unhappy.It's true that women are unhappy -- regardless whether they livein Oslo, Turkey or Egypt.Whether they are poor or rich.Even rich women are unhappy.Because it's the patriarchal system,you know.So we are all in the same boat.And we need to show that in films.And the silence is also very strange.Many women I know...In my family.They are... Let's see...They have education.They have economy, money.And they have good status.But they have had domestic violence.When these women, very strongwomen, doctors, lawyers, teachers, -- when they experience violence, -- they don't talk about it.Because it's not niceto be a broken glass.-You want to be, you know, proper.-You hide...And you hide your broken self.And they don't want meto talk about it, because...It's not nice to be a broken glass.-Yes, exactly.-It's not.I love that. I love this expression,a broken glass.But I feel I am a witness -- to much sorrowand much unhappiness.And I myself haven't experiencedeither domestic violence -- or violence in society.I'm the lucky generation.I feel kind of... I don't know...guilty that's I'm the one -- who receives all the time.The one who receives and receives.I want to give back.Through films and everything.Talking about women's situationis also a very private thing for me.But...But it's difficult becausethey don't want to talk about it.We have lost our true self.Now, in those moments you werecrying, you were the real one.You brought your real self out.But we are afraid, you know?The first fear in our lives is tobe real, to bring out our real self.-Yes.-That's it.How can we bring it into films?When I write a novel,I try to bring my real self.-What is your real self?-Despite everything, -- the one that is full of fearsand tears. Fears and tears.All my life, I've beengetting rid of my fears.Tell me about your fears.What are you afraid of?-Say it, say it!-Okay.If I come from Istanbul and make afilm about how women have suffered...How my mother has suffered,my aunts have suffered.I can make a film. I can belike a bulldozer, you know?And I see myself...Oh my God.And I see myself in Oslo.And if I'm saying the same things...Real things.Real criticism.Then... If...-Then it doesn't work.-I know.This split in me makes me cry.When a man marries a woman,- he may later discoverthat she has flaws.There are 3 solutions:The first is to divorce her,- which will destroy the homeand harm the children;The second is to stay with herwhile hating the situation;The third is to marry a new wife withoutruining the first marriage,- and at the same time making it easier to accept hisfirst wife's flaws by having another one.And statistics prove that there are up to 7 times asmany women in the world as there are men,- so if I give only one woman to every man,I will have condemned millions of women -- to remain unmarried. Is thatthe kind of justice the liberals want?As a fundamental rule in Islam,a woman is seen as a precious jewel.Thus I ask: if you have a jewel,- will you leave it unprotectedin the street, for anyone to grab,- or will you keep it in a velvet box, and hide it fromeveryone except yourself, the owner of the jewel?What's on a Muslim woman's mindwhen she meets a fireman?Lust?Well then, he must be protected.What does a Muslim woman feelwhen she meets an officer?Desire?He should be covered.What makes a Muslim woman excitedwhen she meets a carpenter?His naked body?Sex?He should be wrapped.What's on a Muslim woman's mindwhen she meets a doctor?Orgasm?He must be hidden away.We don't believe in hijab at all,- but as for niqab, we see itas a stain of shame.It is 100% unacceptable, because iterases a woman's personality,- and paralyzes her freedomto work and to truly participate.Even the glance the Salafists consider a sin,- let alone intermingling or kissing!The last fatwa that werecieved from Saudi Arabia -- says that anyone who permitsintermingling is a pimp!Of course, their talk is just nonsense.Polygamy in the Quran was allowedin order to limit polygamy,- because polygamy waswidespread among Arabs.A man could marry 8 or even 10 women.Islam wanted to resist that trend,- so there came a very strangeQuranic verse (4:3).This verse has one condition atthe beginning and another at the end,- for polygamy to be permissable.Muslims have neither understoodthe first nor the second condition;they just kept marrying!The only part they understood form the verse wasMarry women of your choice, 2, 3, or 4.A "polytheist", in the Quran, referred tothe Arabs who worshipped idols -- and were the enemies of Islam.There was always a war going on against them.So, what is prohibited in Islam is not that aMuslim woman marries a Jew or a Christian,- but that she marries a polytheist.However, we can no longer say -- that today's Buddhists, for example,or the adherents of a Chinese religion -- are polytheists like the polytheists back inthe time when Islam first came into being.Maybe in the past, a womanwas not autonomous,- and was too shy to speak outwhen a suitor proposed.Nowadays, women aren'tshy at all, thanks God!She has the right to decidefreely about marriage,- without needing the consentof any "guardian".We also believe that divorce should bevalidated in the same way as marriage,- that is through mutual consent.But that a man monopolizesthe right to instant divorce,- just by saying "you are divorced!" -- this should have no value at all.Even if he keeps saying the words allday and night, it is pure nonsense!I can give you an example of the differencebetween the Quran and Muslims' conceptions:If a Muslim hears a rumor abouthis wife betraying him,- he will grab a knife and kill her,exclaiming "my honor!"The Quran is totally different.In the Quran, even if a man sawwith his own eyes -- his wife in bed with another man,- he couldn't do anything to her.Why? Because there are no witnesses.There are three crimes for whichexecution is instituted:if a man or a woman leaves Islam,- commits adultery or commits murder.But can a Muslim womanmarry a Christian man?The Prophet, praise be upon him, saidwhoever changes his religion, kill him!The case is not as most people think,that there is an absolute freedom of faith.So when a Muslim womanmarries a non-Muslim,- she may be influenced by his religionand may leave Islam.And if she leaves her religion,it would be obligatory for us Muslims -- (via the Islamic state) to kill her for apostasy.This issue has harmful consequencesin both respects:In this life, an apostate should be killed,and in the next, he/she will burn in Hell.Let there be no compulsion in religion.This is written in the Quran.I don't know how one can interpret thisas a justification for violence and hatred.I hope that my children, in the future,through their marriages and their lives,- will bring new religions, new culturesand new languages to our family.It isn't just the fundamentalists,but also the media -- which is obsessed with the falland misery of Muslim women.The world is fixated on statistics!Now it's my turn to be measured.My sexual oppression level is 52.My cultural oppression measures 78.My longing for freedom increaseswhen I see the progressive Muslims -who want to create a new democratic Islamand change women's oppression -- in this patriarchal culture.This demonstration is againstthe violence and aggression.The majority of Muslimsneed to be aware -- that silence can givea wrong impression -- of supporting those who doviolence in the name of Islam.I like your balloon to God.It's like my letter to God.When I was a child, I was veryfurious. So I went to my room -- and wrote a letter to God.I told him, "Dear God."My grandmother told methat you are justice."But now I face injusticein the family, in your name."Because they preferred my brother,though I am much better in school."Because he is a boy. They sayyou said so. Did you say that?"Because if you prefer boys to girls,you are unjust," -- "and I am not readyto believe in you."I feel that my God is in me.And God... In Turkish,we don't have "she" and "he".So my God is sitting inside me,but without any gender, genderless.And God moves in my body, andthis is how I feel it protects me.You must explain what youmean by God in your body.Is it your liver, your spleen?-Your uterus? What's in your body?-It's everything.-It's in your mind.-My brain. My imagination.It's the idea, yes.Imagine the idea of God.The idea of justice.The word of God in the Old Testament,The New Testament, the Quran, -- the word of God is not clear.One needs human beingsto clarify the word of God.My next destination is Turkey.I will film a seminar where,for the first time in history, -- will be trained about women's rightsand violence against women.This is just amazing!All the Imams in Turkeywill take this course.- When did you start giving courses to Imams?- We have been working on it for two years.- The issue of violence towards womenis a very touchy subject.I think what you're doing is very important,- but there are still groups in Turkeywhere men legitimize beating their wives,- because they see themselves asmasters of the household.Imams have immense importancein the shaping of the perception -- of what is right and what is wrong.And still, many men think they canbeat women in the name of Allah.So absurd.- We Imams have incredible power.A woman came to me, and thought thatthe domestic violence she was suffering,- was her payment to God,and was meant to happen.She said: "it's true, my husband beats me,but if I'm patient,"- I will earn my place in heaven.I don't advise her to contact thepolice, but I enlighten her.She says: "my husbandprays five times a day."I find him at work anddrink tea with him.I tell him: "if you beat your wife ever again,I will publically disgrace you,"- which is easy in a small community.- But what if he tells you to stay out of his business?- Oh, he wouldn't dare!- Our ways of understandingIslam might be different.I don't think I need to use hijabin order to call myself a Muslim.- In my understanding, youdon't need to use hijab either.I cover myself out of personal choice,- but you are just as free to be aMuslim and still wear a bathing suit.- A Salafist sheikh from Egypt, told me thata Muslim woman in an interfaith marriage,- can be killed if she leaves Islam.- It has nothing to do with Islam. It showshow his ideas are associated with violence.The writer of the Koran is Allah.He has spoken oncebefore, now he is silent.Who is talking now? We are talking.Nobody can speak on Allah's behalf.- Even if a woman won't admitshe's being physically abused,- you are like doctors,- who look at her bruises,- and determine whenand how they occurred.You have that same abilityto discover such things,- only you are doctors of the soul.- Do we have any examples ofMohammed beating his wives?Isn't it about time we found a newtranslation for the word "beat"?- Your question is very good.Why do we create this distancebetween us and violence?Even though we all seemto agree inside this room,- our male sub-consciousnesswill always be in us.As an Imam, I don't know if I'm ableto see this issue objectively,- without the influence ofcustoms and traditions.- It's very simple; we raise ourdaughters and sons alike.Now I've gotten reactions from some Imams,- who think that boysshould be raised as warriors.I told them that I have two sons, andI don't want any of them to be warriors.When the Imams speak abouta new interpretation of the Quran, -- it triggers my imagination.In the Quran it says:if your wife is disobedient, -- you should first talk to her,then throw her out of bed, -- and if she is still not obedient,you should beat her.But what is the instruction for women?What should a Muslim woman doif her husband isn't obedient?First of all, she should talk to him.Then, she should throwhim out of her bed.No sex for you, darling.And finally, she should beat him.Or should we find a newinterpretation of the word "beat"?Islam is not the only religionstruggling with its views on women.Islam, Christianity and Judaismshare the same origin: Abraham.And these 3 religions also have incommon their belief in only one God.And they all have a history ofthe oppression of women.I wish the women of these 3 religionswould talk together more.We have scriptures -- that tell us to shut upand hide, in a way.Christianity tells usthat women should be silent.It's Paul, isn't it?He's particularly goodat that, isn't he?The question that remained, was whythis God, neither male nor female, -- should speak to empower men?Judaism separateswomen and men in prayer.That can take a variety of forms.Traditionally, if you go intoolder synagogues in Europe, -- you'll find balconies. The womenwere meant to be on balconies.Behind latticework or some sort of...partition of some description.It was thought that men were unableto pray if they could see women.I find that line of reasoning -- oppressive to women's spiritualityand demeaning to men.Is having female religious leadersimportant to prevent violence?I don't romanticize women. Womenare not necessarily better than men.Women do some things differently.Call attention to other perspectives.That's absolutely a responsibility.The Muslim reading of the Quran -- is that there's complete equalityin the religious domain.But women are inferior in society, -- which strikes me as a reallyincoherent argument. It's like:So women and menare equal before God," -- "but unequal in the eyes of men?"How did we get there?If I'm in Pakistan, my awareness,intelligence and knowledge -- counts for nothing.Because the systemis already centered on males.Even to speak as a Muslim woman, -- an interpreter of the Quran,is like, "Who are you?"Asma Barlas is one of the most importantcontemporary female interpreters of Islam.For hundreds of years, therehave been only men -- who have told us how theQuran should be interpreted.Now is the time to hear howwomen read the text.You know, I first foundyou on the Internet.I was goggling Muslim feminists.Even though you don't callyourself a feminist. Why?Well, I think...Once you use that label, many otherconversations get shut down.My country was colonized by Britain.It was disturbing to see that, even -- among modern feminists, there'sthis notion of rescuing the other.And for many Western feminists,Muslim women are the other.A long time ago, through orientalism,Muslim women were described as nude.All the Turkish harems, the themeof all the famous orientalists.All those women lolling around, semi-naked in Turkish baths and hamams.And they always have this style.That was the other.European notions have also changed.Western feminists love this, becauseit's the exact opposite of them.They associate freedom with nudity.But historically only slaveswere denied clothing.It's always, "Muslim women arehelpless, who shall rescue them?"Feminists? The West?Anyone can call themselves feministsnow, even Bush and his wife.They use women to justify war.I also want to speak directlyto Muslims worldwide.We respect your faith.But we condemn the Taliban regime!If I understand you correctly,you say no to some of the hadiths.I say no to all the hadiths which arecontrary to the Quran or undercut it.We cannot attribute something tothe Prophet that would undermine him.Which runs contrary to his methods.It's simple.Anyone could figure it out.The parts of the Quran that describewomen's relationship to God, -- have mostly been stamped out of thescripture, usually through the law.Much of it is done throughsecondary religious texts.-And certain changes need to happen.-So we need to have reform in Islam?If I didn't believe that, I wouldn'tbe reading the Quran as a text -- with multiple possibilities.So why do we continue to make badchoices? Give me one good reason.They claim it's in the Quran.Then say it's in the hadiths.You say, "Why accept hadithsthat contradict the word of God?"Then they say it's in the Sharia orthe Sunnah. They keep evading you.Just like you have a particularunderstanding and relationship -- to Islam through your grandma,I have a relationship to Islam -- through my understandingof the scripture.This is grandmother again.-My goodness!-And this is her.You were pretty serious.And it was actually she whotaught me how to be a good Muslim.Sharia is a human interpretationof provisions in the Quran -- to make laws out of it. It's nota law book, but a scripture.But many people do that.Many nations do that.And in many Islamic nations they usethe Quran as Sharia, as a law book.We should see which verses ofthe Quran would be different now.Taking the same meaningwithout the institution is foolish.So it means that, in that sense,there are some verses in the Quran...I don't mean we can freeze them,but read them as a historical fact.Yes.Imagine that the storygoes like this:Once upon a time, there wereOne of them had a cross,another a Star of David -- and the third had a crescent.They gathered aroundan apple tree -- that had once introducedthe misery in the world.These 3 religious sisterswanted new interpretations -- of the sacred writings.Women's lives would no longer becharacterized by suffering and violence,- but by freedom and love.Such a religion would give spaceto women, and also to me.I had a dream that I senta balloon to Allah.Now I look forward to getting an answer.
