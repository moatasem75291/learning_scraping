L.S./m.F.T.Lucky strike means fine tobacco.Yes, in a cigarette it'sthe tobacco that counts.And lucky strikemeans fine tobacco.- if we thinkof the last centuryThe big breakthroughthat really got us intoThe problem we were--what we have was actuallyA technology innovation interms of the cigarette machine.That immediately allowedus to have millionsAnd billions ofcigarettes being produced.And sales took off.At the time there was notmuch knowledge about the risk.There actually was alreadysome hint of thisBy 1908, 1909, whileit was taking off.Yale researchers werealready starting to publishAnd advocate for peopleto not use tobaccoBecause of fitnessconcerns and lung effects.By the '30s the german'shad started producing data.By the '50s the britishhad started producing data.And then we all knowfinally that 1962The royal college ofphysicians report,Two years later,the surgeon general reportcame outAnd shock horror theseproducts were not just sourcesOf pleasures, peoplethought they wereThey were actuallycausing harm and death.- in the historyof the world, no non-essentialHabit ever got soentranced so fast.Seventy million americans smoke.Today they got a messagefrom the United StatesSurgeon general, who isat a blue ribbon committeeStudying theirhabit for 14 months.- The committee has reachedthe overall judgmentCigarette smoking is relatedto a higher death ratesIn a number ofdisease categories.- if we goback to understandWhen did we first have knowledgeThat it's tar that killsand nicotine that addicts?We now know that batand randall williamsKnew this from the early '60s.You can say thisis a cynical thing,Why didn't theystop at that point?But they were a companywith billions of dollarsInvestment and werenot gonna stop.- I became the winston manIn 1981.I was 32-years-old.And I got a call froman agent in new yorkAnd he wanted to knowif I would be interestedIn coming up for aninterview for an audition.They were doing acasting for winston.So I went in, I had an audition.Two weeks later I get a callThat they narrowed it downand they wanted to see meAgain for a call back.So I had to go up thenext day, unshaven,Because they wanted meto have that rugged look.'cause r.J. Reynoldswas looking for aRugged macho kind of a theme.They come out and say,"you, you, and you."Now these are your newwinston men for 1981 and '82.My jaw dropped, I was floored.I literally was floored.Never ever, ever,ever thinking aboutThe outcome of whatexactly I was doingAnd would have done overthe next eight years.And that was being sevenand a half years asThe winston man, in over 42 adsShowing smoking tobe, associated withhealthy activity.'cause that's alltobacco marketing is.♪ yeah me and my winstons♪ me and my winstons♪ we got a real good thing- After practicing as aphysician I then went intoOrganized medicine andhit it up the organizationWhich is like themothership of doctors.The world medical association.And at that time wewere very, very stronglyAgainst tobacco.Strongly againsttobacco industry,Who we knew had lied aboutthe mortality/morbidityLinked to their product.And we knew that wewere up against a hugeMarketing machine.- the flinstonesHas been broughtto you by winstonAmerica's best selling besttasting filtered cigarette.♪ winstons taste goodlike a cigarette should ♪- did our first shootsup in mt. Evans, colorado.Which was prettyeducational for me becauseYou know what happens toa three pack a day smokerAt 12,000 feet ontop of a mountain?It ain't pretty.Especially whenyou're on oxygen.And you're not able to smokeWhen you're on oxygen,'cause you'll blow up.And I was there for agood five, six daysWith the crew.They were trying tocapture the storyOf what our theme was.Which was search andrescue, storm searcher.We would fly in witha helicopter, okay.We'd be out looking for,whatever we're looking for.Repelling off the side ofthe mountain, which wasWhat they paid me to do.And then, at the end ofthe day was light up time.Sitting on the top of therock, lighting a cigaretteWith your buddy, passingthe cigarette to your buddy.So the theme was, let'stell a story about howMacho these guys are,how they're saving lives,Search and rescue, andthen at the end of the dayThe camaraderie is so specialthat they have to haveA cigarette together tocelebrate their successesThat was the most machismothat they could come up withWhich was now going to competewith the number one brandOf selling cigarettes, whichwas marlboro, at the time.Winston, at that time,was only number four.- 50 head ofcattle headin' for home.Come to where the flavor is.Come to marlboro country.- Within two years winstonbecame the number twoSelling brand, rightbehind marlboro.How did that happen?Marketing.Marketing.Marketing.Spend more money,spend more money.Let's keep associatingthis deadly productWith something that kids want.- Gee, we ought todo somethin' fred.- Okay.How's about taking a nap?- I, I got a better idea.Let's take a winston break.- that's it!- My job was todeliberately to seek outThe vulnerable 13,14, 15, 16, or 17Year old and enticethem into thinkingThat this is what theytoo could be like.That's all I did.26 days a year I had towork for r.J. Reynolds.They paid me over$100,000 a year.Not to mention being onbillboards, magazines,Penthouse, playboy,popular mechanics,Anything that would be amale magazine considered,That's where my ads were.Because we weren't tryingto entice the girlsTo smoke winston.Because they had their own,they had virginia slims,And eve, and satins, and capris.I was ballsy enoughto ask a questionOf the r.J. Reynoldstobacco executive,"how come you guys fromr.J. Reynolds don't smoke?"They said, "we don't smokethe shit, we just sell it."we reserve the right tosmoke for the young, the poor,"the black, and the stupid."And billions of dollarswere there to fund it.They're spending moremoney marketing, okay,Than a lot of people werespending to prevent it.- the u.S. Wasslowly starting to pickIts act up tointroduce some taxes.It couldn't make progresson advertising bansBecause firstamendment protection.The tobacco industry wasthen trying to provideResearch grants toresearchers to buy them off.Or to at least ensure thatthe direction of researchDidn't go in moreof a negative way.And that's when we had theera of the large tobaccoFinance research groupsaround the world.- thetobacco institute.A trade associationwith a unique objective.To promote a freeand informed discussionOf all issues involvingamerica's oldest industry.- we had a studydone by the warton appliedResearch center at theuniversity of pennsylvaniaIn 1979.- We were involved in grantswith the medical collegeOf virginia from 1930 to 1960.- Of course there is anever-ending concern aboutThe alleged effects of smokingon the health of the smoker.- The evidence is certainlyinconclusive at this time.- There is no increase inlung cancer mortality rates.- An individual would haveto sit in a crowded barOr cocktail loungefor more than 100Consecutive hours toinhale the equivalentOf one filtered cigarette.- Well this study was performedby the american cancerSociety.- That was provenWith the study funded, inpart, by the massachusettsLung association.- Which confirms some of ourown thinking on the subject.- I basically got intothe anti-smoking movementRight after I graduatedfrom-- got a masters degreeIn public health.Where I learned that cigarettesare causing more deathsThan everything else combinedAnd nobody was doinganything about itAnd I got a job at the localcounty health departmentAnd I was told, "oh,you have tobacco because"nobody else wants the job."- back then, in the '80sThere were 32billion packs a yearSold of cigarettes in america.32 billion.- Nothing but thebest for mr. Ricardo.- Winston filter brand.- Feel the wonderful smoothnessdeep down in your throat.♪ here's to winston♪ me and my winstons♪ turn to salem- Having done allthese ads that I didAnd feeling prettygood about the moneyI wasn't listening tothe public's opinionAbout tobacco becauseright about then is whenYou started gettingall the negativity.Even though the surgeongeneral's had talked a bad--Talked about secondary smokeAnd cancer being the numberone cause of premature deathand disease.Now this is around1987 now, '86,'87, '88.And I had been doing theads for almost seven years.Now you're gettingall the scuttlebutt.Now you're getting allthe hate, you're startingTo see anger.Smoking's killingpeople, we got proof now.- It's best ifthere is no smokingSo I can stay well.Because it hurts peoplelike me who have asthmaAnd can cause lung cancereven in non-smokers.If I could, I would tell thepresident to make it the lawThat no one smokein public places.- Things in life that he, he'sgonna come in contact withIn growing upThat he doesn'thave control overBecause we livein a free societyAnd we have choices to make.And smokers have choices,as well as non-smokersTo be around people who smoke.- The tobacco industry,from the beginning,First tried to do what Iguess any consumer goodCompany would do,deny the evidence.- If you had your preferenceWould you want your kids,or your grandkids to smoke?Or not smoke?- I have no preference.- We have no preference.- I don't believe thatnicotine, or our products,Are addictive.- likefather, like son.Think about it.For information onsmoking and heart diseaseAsk your heart association.- there's now amovement with the nationalCancer institute,cancer, lung, heart,Not to mention the governmentand surgeon general,That says hey,smoking's killing peopleAnd we got proof now,now we got evidenceWe got tobacco files, wegot people talking about it.Now it's starting toget a little curious.Because I'm getting thesame thing from my kids.Daddy, quit smoking, my teachersays you're gonna croak.Daddy, quit smoking,you're gonna die.Dad, you're gonna--What happens?My brother gets cancer.My brother, I was the youngestof three boys in my familyAnd he was my older brother,he was only three and a halfYears older.And he was diagnosedwith cancer.And he was a smoker.And, for about five years Ihad to watch him deteriorate.And I'm doing the ads.When I did the ads, I was stillWorrying about my brother.And I had this horribleexperience of drivingTo boston, and he was in thedana farber cancer institute.And I walked through the doors.Here we have oncologists,doctors, nursesPeople taking care ofpeople who are dying,Literally dying,From what they chose todo at 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,Et cetera.Now they have to pay the price.So now I'm startingto get a littleClued in here.Well, maybe this is bad.Maybe this garbageis killing people.My brother's dying from it.I'm certainly not feelingthe way I did when I was 16Smoking a pack a day.Now I can't get up anddown stairs quite as much.So I'm starting to see thelogic behind all the hate.I started seeing smokersbeing seen, not only asCool, macho, tough, rugged,beautiful, sexy, glamorous,Fun loving, free spirited,But smelly, stinky,yellow-toothed people.Now you're startingto see the segue from60% of the americanpeople smokingOr chewing ordipping or spitting,And now you're startingto see the swing.I had to make a decisionand there was a six hourRide home.And I probably smokedtwo packs of cigarettesOn that ride home.'cause now I'm stressed.Now I'm starting to feelpretty bad about this becauseNow I gotta go face my kid.And I talked to my sonAnd I walked in the doorAnd he talked to me.He said, "dad, you're gonnadie like uncle bob, right?"Boom!Just like that.That's how it hit me.It was like a boom.You knowThere's a goodchance that I will.That was my epiphany.So long agoThat's how it hit me.And, my passion for my kids,And my wife was so grandthat I was gonna beat it.Okay, so I made adecisionIt was July 17th,when I told my son,"I'm gonna quit."I promise, I'm gonna quit."And, right hand up togod, "I'm gonna quit,"I'm gonna quit."And he said, "okay dad,you promise, right?"Well what you don'ttell a 10 or 11-year-oldIs something then not do it.'cause they will hound you,and they will hound you,And they will hound you.Well he hounded me untilthe great american smokeoutIn November of 1988.- You see this fan?Well, I use it while I'maround cigarette smokers.But I may get a chanceto throw it awayDuring the greatamerican smokeout.The day the american cancersociety asks every smokerIn america to quit for 24 hours.- I picked that day.I told my son I was gonna quit.And, I did.I get a call from everyphiladelphia news station,Television station.I get a call from cbs thismorning with harry smith.I get a call fromabc, I get a callAnd they're pickingme up by limoThey're taking me to new york.No one had ever quitsmoking publicly,Especially the winston manwho's on every billboard,Every magazine, everywherefor eight years now,Going on eight years.And then he's bitingthe hand that feeds him.My brother's dying of cancer.I promised my kids I wouldn'thurt myself like my brother.And I've seen so manypeople dying that I'm notGonna do these ads anymore.I can't do it.I cannot physically, andmorally, do it anymore.- Image has been a great concernfor the tobacco industry.The person we choosethis week was onceOne of the industriesleading image maker.- The tobacco industry hadreally played out to the peakOf what it was going to dotrying to thwart policies- Our long and difficultfour-year journey downtobacco roadHas come to a victorious end.- The largest financialrecovery in the historyOf the world.- We've arrived atour final destination,And that's the destinationof tobacco justice.- Close to 33,000 lawsuitsagainst big tobacco.The precedence were being set.So now if one person sues,and you got the same diseaseThen so on, and so on,and so on, and so on.So they sat around, and said,"let's come up with a way."And they went to meetings,they went to private meetingsAccording to the tobaccofiles that I've been privy to.And they said, "we've gotto come up with something"that's going tostop these lawsuits."Well, here's whatyou're gonna have to doBig tobacco people.You're gonna have togive us some money backIn order for us toconvince our constituencyThat that money, 'causewe're sick and tiredOf paying formedicare, and medicaidRehabilitation and preventionBecause your product hascost us and our state.Michael moore didit, in mississippi.Michael moore tookon big tobacco, said,"I'm gonna sue your asses."He's the only one that did it.He sued, and won12 billion dollars.So then it becameeven more importantThat they justify thismoney being spent.Even if it was fora year, or two.They've never said theywere gonna use it foreverIn the 25 years thatthey're gonna get it.Florida said, oh my.I'd like some of that.We have the same problem.We're suing too.They've got 11 billion.Texas did it, theygot 13 billion'cause it was allbased on per capitaAnd pro-rated anumber of citizens.Minnesota did it.Four states got46 billion dollarsIn a matter of a week.46 billion.Well, every other state wantedto touch-- a piece of that.We want some of that.We, we're paying medicare too.So let's come up with a numberthat everybody can live with.They came up with 200 billion.Plus the 46 that wentpreviously to those four states.And they gave attorneygenerals 72 hoursTo sign on.And the only way theywould get any moneyIf they signed on without evenknowing what was going on.And you'll get your moneyover the next 25 years.Every state did it, okay.But, in that decisionin 72 hours they had toSign off that they would notlet anybody in their stateSue big tobacco.That was in 1999, and themsa became the first bailout.Yeah, we need it for the kids.We need it for the children.We need it for prevention.Education.Intervention.Cessation.We need all the ta ta.- Like you, the nation'sattorney's general have beenFighting to help reversethe staggering tollTobacco takes on our society.And to protect our childrenfrom a lifetime of addiction.- This plan, in short,will get big tobaccoOff the backs of our kids.- They got the money.They signed on.And then within two yearsthat money'sgone.They either put it in bonds,where they can't pay it back.They used it for road repair,waterfront restoration.They used it for healthdepartment's new computers,The states are not usingthe money that they saidThey needed, and thetobacco companies are nowGiving all thismoney to the states.And then nobody knew thatwithin 48 hours after theyGave up 246 billion dollarsThey raised the priceof cigarettes 48 centsAcross the board,to make up the 246.Nobody cares about it,nobody wants to talk about itBecause it's notscandalous enough.- The tobacco industryhas conceded defeat.And we have a settlementof historic proportions.- What did new jersey do?They sold all theirmoney in a bond.Now it's due to be paid backAnd new jersey doesn't havethe money to pay it back.There's eight statesthat had done that.The other states wastedthe money on everythingBut prevention,education, cessation.So there is more corruption,there's more governmentIntervention forkeeping tobacco aliveAnd keeping the bigtobacco monopoliesRaising half a trilliondollars a year.Half a trillion, if not more.That's what they admit to.- by the timeof the minnesota court caseIn 1998, the state ofminnesota didn't only seekRedress in financial terms,But required thatthe tobacco industryPlace all of theirpreviously secret documentsIn the public domain.And from then on, we knewthe road map of the industryAnd what it hadbeen since the '60s.So it was only in retrospectthat we actually understoodJust how deep and pervasivethe influence had beenAt the government level,at the research level,And at the individualministry area level.As tobacco rates startfalling to maybe 20%Or below 20%, you're gettinginto a hardcore groupOf smokers who are notsmoking out of pure triceBut they're smokingbecause they are addictedAnd they have a physical needfor nicotine in their lives.- I started smokingcigarettes at 12.And, really if I thinkabout it, my daughter'sNot too far from 12.And thinking of hersmoking a cigarette isReally just sickening.The first time I ever smokeda cigarette a few of myFriends had come overto spend the night.And one of the olderones had brought a packOf cigarettes fromher dad's carton.We proceeded to go to thetree house across the streetAnd we smoked the entirepack of cigarettes.I remember it made me sick.It made me dizzy,but more importantlyI remember fromthat moment forwardWanting to smoke cigarettes.So, at 12, I mean youcan't really go outAnd buy a pack of smokes.So I would basicallydo what I could.I would take theBurning cigarettesfrom the ash trayWhen my mother wasn't looking.Or, take cigarettesOut of her pack.Or, even worse, Iwould take the buttsOut of the ash tray, whichis really disgusting.- It was not easy.I probably quit seven,eight, nine times.And I come back hating myself.My son looked at me, andhe looked so disappointed.He knew I was smoking.He knew that I hadjust failed miserably.But when the mindsetsays I need to quit,I want to quit, I have toquit, I'm going to quit.And then you try and youfail, you try and you fail,You try and you fail,you try and you fail.After awhile you say,screw it, I'm done.I'll go to my grave smoking.- And those are thepeople that are facingAlmost all the risks.Those are the people thatare gonna account for99% of the lung cancers,Chronic obstructivepulmonary diseasesAnd heart diseasescaused by smoking.- We always need a disruptionTo actually shift the marketand the market forces.And I believe that honlik's work as the inventorOf an e-cigarettereally representsThis disruptive change.- Just a brilliant,brilliant, brilliantMoment in time which lotsof things came togetherAnd hon lik took it andactually made it a reality.- Hon lik came up withthis brilliant inventionAnd that's the mark ofa true innovator, okay.Somebody that can paradigmlycan shift things intoA whole new way of doing things.- it was in 2005.Originally, I wasn't that excitedWhen I saw just themanual reading about itBecause I'm not a smoker.When I actually saw the productWith the vapor coming outI knew there wassomething there.So then we worked onit for about a year.And so I officiallyformed siterraIn September of 2006and we launched it.Really our big breakthroughwas the ces showJanuary of 2008.- I'm here at cesAnd, I'm mostly interestedin gadgets and things.But, this caught my eye.This guy is here, and heis not smoking next to me.Because there is nosmoking on the show floorBut he's not smoking.What is, whatexactly is in njoy?- Njoy is anelectronic cigarette.And the way that we dothis, is we take a battery.From the battery we have apatented vaporization system.So what you're seeingcoming from the deviceIs not smoke.It's vapor.- it became the hit ofthe show and became written upIn a bunch of magazines,and even online.- it's a huge memoryvoid as to where I gotMy first e-cigarette.All I know is that I had in 2007Two or three e-cigs.One from china, onefrom america, one fromSomewhere in europe.And I'm playing with them,that's all I remember.And they're wonderful things,like absolutely amazing.But they're also really bad.I mean, they are, what theyare are a proof of concept.And I'm struck bythe potential here.Thinking, oh my god,this will be the productThat can transformsmokers lives.But, this ain't gonna do it.And then I thought, well, mygod there must be other peopleSaying the samething as me, thinkingClose, very, very close.And so, you know,where do you go?You look on the web.And, nothing.Nothing.A few dodgy commercials,if you kind of, you knowI-stock photo images of people.I thought, god, weneed a conversation.We need to start a conversation.And what a better wayto do that than the mostAntiquated form ofinternet communications,A forum, that's whatwe need, a forum.So I set it up one nightin, I think, December 2007.And,Not much happened.So, I went up, as you doAround the internet,and said hey guysIf you want to talk aboutit come to my website.And people came.And we started aconversation aboutWhat are these products?Where do they comefrom, who sells them,How much do they cost?But principallyThese things got to get better.How are they gonna get better?You know? What's the--And we got very anal about it.So we were taking photographs ofTiny little pieces of metalAnd connections and screws,and things like this.- I think that Ihad seen a news story onCnn, or something, aboutthis new gadget calledAn electronic cigarette.And I was a heavy smoker.So, you know, I hada love of electronicsAnd gadgets, and I smokedAbout two and ahalf packs a day.So I thought, well,whatever this thing isIt must be for me.So, I went online andI found oneAnd back in thosedays, you know, 2007,All you could buy was these bigBulky pen style e-cigs.And I bought one, notthinking much about it.And it showed up one dayAnd I put it togetherAnd, not really thinkingit would be too impressiveBut I took a drag,and I was stunnedI was absolutely stunned.It was, I couldn't believe atHow closely it mimickedthe sensation of smoking.And I remember later thatday, four hours had gone byAnd it occurred to methat I had forgottenTo have a cigarette.I was just amazed by thisWay more than Ithought I would be.But there was one thingI was not amazed byAnd that was by the taste.It tasted awful.You really didn't know,in those days, you didn'tKnow where the liquidwas coming from.You didn't know howit was being made.You didn't know what was in it.In those days, youmight be lucky ifYou'd get a littleplastic bottleWith some liquidin it that said,"vanilla" or whatever.And that was it.There were no companiesin the United States.Everything was being madeoverseas at the time.And I was reallysurprised by that.So, at that point, itwasn't about startingA company for me.It was about creating aliquid that I wanted to vape.That's all it was.So, I started justTrial and error, a lotof trial and error.I went out and boughtall the tobacco I could.I bought cigarette tobacco,pipe tobacco, cigar tobacco.And just created thisgiant tobacco mixture.And what I decided to do wasI went and got five coffeemakersAnd I lined them upon my kitchen counter.And, I brewed,essentially tobacco water.And I would use thatwater as the water toFilter it all over again.By the time I was done,I had a essentiallyA highly concentratedtobacco reduction.And this, this wasthe primary flavoring.I went onto the ecfAnd I asked ifanyone wanted to tryMy new smoke juice, thatI was calling it by then.And, you know, if you wanta free sample, let me knowAnd I'll send it to you.And kind of figured maybe,12, 13 people would reply.And I had over 300 replies.And it took about two weeksAnd I got everysingle request out.And then the waiting began.And it was the longestweek of my life.And so I'll never forgetabout six days laterI got an emailFrom someone who Iknew was sampling it.And, and I rememberI had to pull overBefore reading the emailbecause I figured, okay,Well it's all gonnacome down to this.Either they hate it,or they love it.And, so I pulled overI looked at theemail and it said,You have to tell mehow I can buy this.And, I thought, okay wellMaybe we have something then.- it was around2010 and I saw a friend.He had a ciga, like,You know, e-cig.I asked him about it andthought, oh that's cool.A few months laterI did some researchAnd I got online and I foundthere was a company in the ukThat was selling better devicesthan what my friend had hadAnd I bought one.And the day that e-cig arrivedWas it was a life changer.Literally, as soonas I started using itI never had another cigarette.I lost it one night whenI was out with friends.And in the morning, I couldn'tfind it, and it was gone.And they're all quiteexpensive back then andYou had to orderthem from overseasAnd I couldn't afford toreplace it immediatelyAnd I couldn't haveeven if I wanted to,there were no shops.There was nowhere to buy themin australia at the time.So I went back to smokes.My sister died at34 years old.From non-hodgkin's lymphomaIn her lungs.And, there's no questionthat it was the smokingThat did it to her.And, I've been tryingto quit for yearsAnd this had been thething, the game changer,That changed everything for me.Not being able to buy itlocally just seemed insane.So I started a businessand it was great.It was almost word of mouthat the beginning it wasJust an online store.But it started toget some traction- The hobbyist side ofthings that you see todayReally startedvery, very early onWith this kind of real obsessionWith precisely whatthese devices are.And what made twodevices different.And that's reallyhow it all started.- As we've seen in so manyother areas of technology,Suddenly the cozy wayin which public policyHas driven tobacco waschallenged by something new.- I don't think that peopleeither on the public health sideOr the tobacco side, expectedhow consumers would respond.'cause it seems that theformulation of the earlyE-cigarettes met a need ofa smoker to have what theyReally what many of themwanted, 70, 80% want.To get nicotine'spleasures without gettingthe damaging effects.- have wegot a solution for you.The all-exclusive smokingeverywhere electronic cigarette.Are you ready for a change?- In 2009 and 2010,us customs agentsSeized almost 1,000shipments of e-cigarettesAt us ports.- they made adetermination that it wasA drug delivery device.That since it wasbattery operatedThat it was a device.And therefore undertheir fda drug deliveryThere wasn't fda approvalfor it,That they couldseize the product.And they seized, Ithink probably aboutHalf a million dollarsworth of product.And the product, when theygot it back, was worthless.- Two e-cigarette companies,smoking everywhere and njoy,sued the fdaIn 2009.- We were reasonablypessimistic at the timeAnd of course, we hadnowhere near the numbersOf people using the products.- This was an industrythat needed all theHelp it could get.- one of our moderatorswas actually day to dayChecking the court documentsAnd finding out whetherthere had been an update.We were on tenterhooks.I mean, I talk about the ecfwould only last two years,But right then, we werethinking everything wasGonna just disappear.There was absolutelyno certainty whatsoeverThat the judgmentwas gonna come backAgainst what the fdawas doing at the time.- There as definitelya prevailing sense thatIf the ruling came downin favor of the fdaIt likely would have meantthe end of the industryBefore it really had had achance to get off the ground.- I filed an amicus briefwith the dc court of appealsIn 2010 in supportof their case.And we won.- the us district courtfor the district of columbiaHas issued a decisiongranting leading globalElectronic cigarettebrand njoy's motionFor preliminary injunctionseeking to preventThe fda from detaining,or refusing admissionInto the us of its electroniccigarette products.- We had the hearingin September of 2010.And actually on pearl harborday, December 7th, votedThree-nothing in our favor.The fda tried to appeal again.They turned them down.They announced theyweren't gonna appealTo the supreme court.- There's a lot ofcelebrating going on.- Njoy's a heroin this industry.For having carried thatcase to its final conclusionThey really are.Because without that, Idon't think anybody elseCould have steppedup to the plate.- I remember thinking thatThis is the startof the industry.- there's a newwarning this morning thatE-cigarettes may not beas safe as they seem.The new England journal ofmedicine says e-cigaretteUsers are five to15 times more likelyTo get formaldehyderelated cancersThan long-term smokers.Formaldehyde is the toxicchemical found in the devices.- This is the part inour journey where peopleAre actually using thesedevices reached out to us.They felt like it hadto save their livesYet it was under attack.At first, we were skeptical.Just like everyone else,we'd seen the headlinesThat vaping might be moredangerous than smokingCigarettes.- This is a dangerous product.- It is a poisonousproduct of nicotine.- New studies show thate-cigarettes are more deadlyThan regular cigarettes?- These reallyhave me concerned.- These products areexposing you to a varietyOf toxic chemicals.- Understanding thatover a billion peopleAre gonna die thiscentury from smokingWe knew we had tofind the truth.Because I'm not asmoker, or a vaper,We packed our bags andheaded around the worldTo meet with leadingscientists and health expertsTo find out whatwas really going on.- I think the first thingthe world needs to knowAbout vaping isthat all of the harmAnd the billion livesthat we're talking aboutAnd in tobacco use,comes from smoking,Comes from setting fire to itAnd inhaling the smoke.So it's the toxicparticles, the toxic gases.That's what's doing the damage.- The real problem is ifyou set tobacco a lightAnd you inhale it,It's bad for you.If you put a pieceof beef in the ovenAnd you overcook itAnd you eat it,it's bad for you.Anything you set to lightand inhale or ingestIs bad for you.- If you weren't to smoke,you've solved the problem.We know how to dealwith the smoke.So, I think peopleworking on thisEvery morning, just likeclinton when he first ranFor president hadthat sign saying,"it's the economy stupid."To remind him every daywhat to concentrate on.It's really simple.It's the smoke stupid.- A normal cigarette hasat least 4,000 toxicants.Including-- it hasnicotine, as well.And if a consumer wouldtake all of that on boardThey are-- one out oftwo of those consumersWill develop diseaseand die an early death.Solid evidence to back that up.- If somebody would have said,"bill, can you think of a"parameters of a productto replace cigarettes."Theoretically I've hadsaid, "well, it would be"99% less hazardousthan cigarettes."it wouldn't beaddicting non-smokers."it wouldn't encourage anybodyto switch to cigarettes."and it would help lotsof people quit smoking."That's the ideal solutionto the cigarette epidemicIn this world.And it's called vaping.- It's not smoking.There's no tobacco.Nothing is lit on fire.Vaping uses a battery,Which powers an atomizer,Which vaporizes a liquid.Which may, or may not,have nicotine in it,Has a flavoring, and ismade with an fda approvedFood grade liquid base.- Well I first becameinterested when some of the mostHardened smokers that I sawas a general practitionerStarted giving upwith the use of these.That really sort ofsparked my fascinationWith this whole ideaof turning the ideaOf quitting on its headinstead of being aboutDenial and withdrawal.But being aboutsomething excitingAnd somethingbetter than smoking.- it's gonnabe one of the biggestContributions to publichealth this century.It's a reallytransformative technology.And just think back ahundred or plus yearsWhen the cigarettewas first invented,That was transformative.It did away with allthe other kinds ofTobacco products.E-cigarettes are gonna beequally transformative.- It can save a billion lives.- Anytime someone attacksa promising alternativeTo a massive problemAnd you have to ask, why?The answer is money.MoneyAnd one of the most fascinatingalliances in history.- Well there are lotsof forces that playPro-vaping, and anti-vaping.And it's hugely complex.- The war on vaping beganwith the fdas attack.But they weren't theonly ones on their side.To fully understand thisalliance that formedWe need to go tothe american southAnd the theory of thebaptists and the bootleggers.In many counties, theyhold periodic votesTo decide the fateof alcohol sales.An unholy alliance formsbetween the preachersWho don't want alcohol beingused in their communities.And the bootleggers arewilling to sell alcoholWhen and where it's not legal.They're happy to help thepreachers restrict alcohol salesBecause that killstheir competition.It's a classic exampleof the enemy of my enemyIs my friend.At the end of the day theyboth drive around townWith the same bumper stickers.Unfortunately, counties thatvote to restrict alcoholSales have higher rates ofdrunk driving fatalities.We see the same twosides in the vaping wars.You have the bootleggerswho are opposed to vapingFor business reasons.And you have the preacherswho are opposed to vapingOn moralistic grounds.Well let's talk aboutthe bootlegger side.Remember big tobacco?They don't like competitionfor their one trillionDollar business.- analysts sayelectronic, or e-cigarettesWill become a twobillion dollar industryWorldwide by theend of the year.With some predictingsales will outpaceConventional cigaretteswithin five to 10 years.- Cigarette companies realizeThat e-cigarettesare now a threatTo the old business.- And, are they?- It's one of the very rarecases where you haveSuch controversyabout the product.And to the point thatpeople don't understand thatIt is the main competitorof tobacco cigarettes today.The e-cigarette isthe main competitorof tobacco cigarettes.- some peoplehave had changes in behavior,Hostility, agitation,depressed mood,And suicidal thoughtsor actions while takingOr after stopping chantix.Some people can have allergicor serious skin reactionsTo chantix, some of whichcan be life threatening.Patients also reportedtrouble sleepingAnd vivid, unusualor strange dreams.Talk to your doctor tofind out if prescriptionChantix is right for you.- Drug companies knowthat doctors hold allThe real power in theprescription drug business.- break thehold of nicotine addiction.See your doctorabout treatments.- While they spend nearlyfour billion dollarsA year marketing directly to usThey spend an estimated24 billion dollars a yearMarketing directly to doctors.- Big pharmaceuticalcompanies also lovinglyKnown as big pharma,want to protect theirSix billion dollar nicotinereplacement therapy business.- not only arethey trying to banAll their competitors,The smoke-free alternatives,But they are trying topromote gums, patches,Lozenges and anyfda approved drugsAs the only effectivewas to quit smoking.- I'm not a big fanof nicotrol, nicaband,Habitrol.The inhalers.Which contain the exactsame thing that vapingDevices have.The propylene glycol.The only thing it doesn'thave is the the flavors.- nicotinereplacement therapyWhich is not anattractive product at all.And it does not deliverthe success that it should.- Okay, I'm gonnacook the purple one.- he gets theprescription from his doctor.It's also found inthe over the counterAnti-smoking drug zyban.But crushed,cooked, and injectedIt delivers a crackcocaine-like high.Each hit leaves a scar.Skin abscesses, collapsed veins,And clogged arteries.Injuries attributed toinjecting wellbutrinAnd zyban.It's killed sixpeople in ontario.- people go out andget prescription for chantix.No, that was fast-trackedthrough the fda.It has a blackbox warning on it.Could cause you tohave suicidal thoughts.Could cause youto commit suicide.But that's fine, let's just keepselling that crap, you know.- If you look atthe united kingdomAnd the solid evidencewhich is being built up byRobert wist, it showswithout any doubtThat e-cigarettes havealready supplantedNicotine replacementtherapy, medicine,As the preferred wayfor smokers to quitOr to substitute their smoking.- So if you have apharmaceutical companyWho's starting to seeyour share of the marketOn nicotine replacement therapySlide relative to these--up and comingE-cig people, whatare you gonna do?You're gonna sit onyour bum and do nothing?- under the koreanlaw, electronic cigarettesAre considered cigarettes.Until comprehensive researchproves that e-cigarettesAre harm-free, and contributeto quitting smoking.Nicotine patches or chewsthat are scientifically provenTo be safe, should be promoted.- It made sense to findbig tobacco and big pharmaIn the bootlegger camp,'cause they sell things.But it was confusing tous when we found nationalGovernments wereright there with them.- Governments worldwideare the biggestShareholders in therevenue of cigarettes.- Using the unitedstates as an a example,In 2010, the year that thefda went after vaping,The federal governmentcollected 15 and a halfBillion dollarsin tobacco taxes.Just three years later, aftervaping began to take off,Tobacco taxes were downto 14 billion dollars.That's a difference of oneand a half billion dollars.- The e-cigarette industryshould be put out of business.- The government's gettingbillions of billionsOf billions of tax revenue.- But it's not just the taxes.Some countries actually owntheir own tobacco companies.- The chinese nationaltobacco corporationIs the main supplierof cigarettes.It's 100% owned by thechinese government.So in effect, thechinese governmentIs the world's largesttobacco company.- japan tobaccoowns the camel brand.Besides those two, thereare 14 other countriesThat own largetobacco companies.So who are the preachers?Unfortunately, theseare the people smokersGo to for advice.Their medical professionalsand other healthcareOrganizations.Like the cdc,Fda,And the worldhealth organization.- The fundamentaltruth, I think is thatThe battle in the endbecame very personalized.It became public healthversus the tobacco industry.- Tobacco control hashad decades of doingThe same things.Just, you know, screwingdown the controlsA bit harder, increasingthe taxes a bit more.Doing plain packaging.None of which I disagree with.But, when something comes outof totally out of left field,I don't think they knowhow to deal with it.- The groups that werekind of in charge of thatAround the world, felt thatreally they were in theFinal leg, the final pushWould just endthis story forever.- And now we cannotallow e-cigarettesTo snuff out theprogress we've madePreventing nicotine addictionand its deadly consequences.- It's shocking to hear,I almost, you know, flinchWhen I hear, colleaguessaying thingsAbout e-cigarettes that weknow, or they should knowAre completely wrong,exaggerated, or scare-mongering.There's too muchof that going on.- We don't know enoughresearch in terms ofThe long-term risks.- The jury's out on this one.They might, or might notbe able to help you quitBut there are definiteharms that they can cause.- We don't yetknow about vaping.- It's the same as antifreeze.- We used to have verydangerous productsAnd the makers of thoseused to lie about those.We now have much safer productsAnd the public healthcommunities lying about those.- We know that they don'tactually allow peopleTo stop smoking.- now there'seven more evidence thatThat these are a gateway tosmoking regular cigarettes.- These cigarette makersare making these for kids.Because they make chocolate,and other flavors.- What's going on?- Frankly, they don't thinkthey can see too clearlySometimes when itcomes to a productThat involves nicotine,like e-cigarettes.Because of the associationwith tobacco that justSeems to blot out thesun for these people.And they can't look atthe facts as objectivelyAs they otherwise might.- In many people's mind,nicotine is so closelyAssociated withtobacco and smoke.That they don't separate out.This is just oneof the componentsIn a cigarette.- What we always used to sayin the stop smoking servicesIs that nicotine is asaddictive as heroin and cocaine.But actually, we'refinding more nowThat once you take itout of the cigaretteWhich we know has gotother chemicals intoEnhance the action of nicotineIt doesn't seem tobe so addictive.- You never see anyonesniffing pure nicotine.You never see anyoneinjecting pure nicotine.No one wants to inject or touse nicotine in a pure formAnd you know itwould be much cheaperTo get nicotine as a solutionRather than to use, totake it from cigarettes.But everyone likescigarettes because it'sNot only nicotine.- It's not particularlydangerous in itself.Some people are saying,well, in terms of riskIt may be on the levelwith, say, coffeeOr something like that.- nicotine isa mild stimulant.We have data from swedenwhich-- where they haveHuge rates of nicotine useLifelong use.The rates of lungcancer are half thatOf the rest of europe.The rates of heartattacks are half thatOf the rest of europe.And the reason is becausethe tobacco they useIs a special smokelesspasteurized product called snusWhich is a harm-reductionproduct, much the sameAs electronic cigarettes are.And so we know that reallylifelong use of nicotineYou can't measure anysignificant healthImpacts from that.- The data we have on thatis, it really comes fromLooking at peopleusing patches and gums.And the data show thatyou can use nicotineFor many many years.- Many people have goneon to be lifelong usersIncluding I might say my sister,With no additional risk,but dramatic declinesIn their probability of risks.And I think part of itis the way physicians,Nurses, healthprofessionals get trainedAnd the way they sendtheir message forwardThey often don't knowthat very simple fact.- What I'm extremelydisappointed with in myselfAnd in our movement,especially around theFramework conventionon tobacco controlIs that we did not recognizethe simple role of nicotine,Molecule nicotine,And the possibility oftobacco on reduction.Frankly you don'tget people to moveAnd especially notone 1.4 billion peopleTo move by giving them a sermon.And lecturing them andsaying, you quit or you die.Here's some nicotinereplacement therapy, or gumOr your patch, you'llonly be allowed to use itFor 12 weeks.Because, you're the bad person,you need to stop smoking.And use this and then let'shope that we can fix you.And that's a gap, andit's a great failing.- what struck me, wasin my career, which extendsFrom working on tobacco insouth africa through who,Is how rarely weactually make the pointVery clearly, that nicotineaddicts, tar kills.That very simple separationof what's in a product.And yet we'veknown it for years.It was in the originalsurgeon general's reportIn 1964, clearly statedThat long-term use ofnicotine alone confersVery little to noharms on people.- do thoseprofessionals actually knowHow people die of smoking?And then you get to thedisturbing fact thatIf you ask thequestion to, let's sayThe physicians in america,"does nicotine cause cancer?"Simple question.Does that cause cancer?70% of them would say yes.And the science isabsolutely clearThat nicotine isnot a carcinogen.It is an addictive agent.So it's part of the ritualand the attractivenessOf people smoking cigarettes.But it's not thenicotine that kills,It's the tar and the smoke.We weren't honestwith our patients.If health professionals, andthose who are in a positionOf trust, where peoplewould want to confideOr discuss quitting,You would want them tohave the right information.And that, to me,was the shockingShocking part, in myself,is that IDid not know that nicotineis not a carcinogen.So where I would havebeen in a position to helpMy patients, or familymembers who smokeWith less harmful productsSo that they, if theycouldn't stop or quit smokingThey'd at least switch tosomething less harmful.And unfortunately, thehealth professionalsEspecially physiciansare normallyNot in a position where they getFeedback when they are wrong.Very honest to say that Ipersonally got it wrong.- Fda's own fundedscientists came out and saidThat vapers areexposed to dramaticallyLess toxicants thanSmokers.And they are exposed to verysimilar levels of toxicantsAs non-tobacco users.Unfortunately, the fdaofficials, when theyTalk to the newsmedia, don't say that.- The dilemma is you, youcan't get 1.4 billion people.It's the size ofthe catholic church.It's the size of theindian population.All to quit smokingcigarettes tomorrow.It's just not going to happen.So the alternativeis to provide safer,Not safe, butsafer alternatives.- all these otherproducts are so much lessHazardous.And yet, our public healthagencies are saying,No, no, you have toabsolutely stop all tobaccoAnd all nicotine use.That's their goal.♪ lollipop lollipop♪ oh lolli lolli lolli♪ lollipop lollipop♪ oh lolli lolli lolli♪ lollipop lollipop- As we look at thearguments against vapingFrom the preachers, it seemsthat there's an issue of pride.Nobody likes to admitthat they're wrong,Especially whenthey're the expert.- my name isserena chen, I'm with theAmerican lung association.- Every time we watched apublic hearing about vapingIt was intriguing to seethat one of the majorHealth charities was thereto attack it immediately.- The anti-tobacco communityIs also a smalleconomy in itself.- Cancer, heart, andlung, for the last20 years, their tobaccocontrol advocacyHas all been financedby pharmaceutical grantsAnd contracts.- I found out that cancer's150 billion dollar industry.Hmmm.The american cancersociety, you know,Most profitable non-profitorganization out there.- Every advertisementon television you sawFor gums, patches, andlozenges for the nicoderm,Nicorette, and commit lozengeIt said, sponsored by theamerican cancer societyAnd it had the americancancer society logo on it.- Every state has a chapter,every county has a chapter,And every city has a chapter.17 to 18% of thatmoney goes to research.The rest goes to themulti-million dollar salariesOf all of the ceos, cfos,Coos, cdos,Clos.Everybody's got-- and soon and so on and so on.I just know that people keepdonating year after yearAfter year after yearand we have more walksAnd more relaysand more ribbons.Because people haven'tdone what the problemNeeded to be done.And that is, stop thesource of the problem.You go to a river, yousee a baby floating down,A dead baby floating down.You pull in the dead baby,I'll pull a dead baby,Another dead baby comesout, pull out a dead baby.All we're doing isreaction, pull out dead.Look, go to the beginningof the mouth of the riverAnd see who's throwingthe babies in.Then stop that personthen maybe we won't haveThe dead babiesfloating down the river.I know I'm beingobnoxious here, butIt's as simple as that.- If the tobacco model aswe know it were to changeDrastically, allof those ngo'sWould be out of business.They're holding onto the phone,They don't wantthe phone to die.- Then I startedinvestigating the productAnd I could see the potential.I was worried, also,Because potential was very high.I said, wow, my smokingcessation centerWould be out ofbusiness in a matter ofA few years.- So we have the bootleggersWith their billions of dollars.And we have the preachersWith their loud voicesand trusted brands.How does this truthstand a chanceEspecially when the vastmajority of vaping advocatesAre a rag tag bunchof unorganized vapers.And their loudest groupare the cloud chasers.♪ I hear the freaks,freaks, freaks come

patch.You know, you don'tsee any chat like that.You see masses of chatin the forums and so on,People talking about thesedevices, how they're using themAnd so, it's kindof interesting.It's kind of a bitof a community sense.- they'rehanging out together.They're a group again.They're family.They were persecuted, hewas persecuted, and she was--So now they canall come togetherAnd they're not gonna bepersecuted anymore becauseThey've done whatwe've asked them to doAnd that is find asafer alternative.♪ whoa whoa- But the vastmajority of vapersAre moms and dads,Grandmas and grandpas,Your neighbors,Who are desperatelytrying to quitSomething that isslowly killing them.- I'm from the uk.I'm a dad.An it engineer.A vaper.An archer.A cook.A husband.Used to be a chemist.And,Used to be a smoker.I tried an rt, andI've tried cold turkey.And I tried all sortsof things to tryTo give up smokingbecause I knewThat it was making me ill.And the year before I stoppedsmoking I had more thanFour serious chestinfections that requiredInhalers, and drugs,you know, it was crazy.Just over five years ago Icame across this bad boy.I haven't got ridof it because well,It's kind of a savior.On that day I stoppedsmoking tobacco.That was it.I quit.That's pretty powerful stuff.I just got the device myself.I didn't need anyone's help.I didn't need a prescription.I didn't need adoctor's say so.I didn't need a hand outfrom the government.Or the health authority,or a charity.I just quit smoking.That's mad.That's kinda cool.- In the meantime, thepeople who have the power toHelp them quit smokingfind themselvesIn a conflict of interests.Let's look at the fda.The fda is known to havea history of hiring peopleFrom big pharma, and thenonce they're done at the fdaThey go back to big pharma.It's a revolving door.The current head of thefda center for tobaccoIs a former lobbyist forthe big pharma companyThat sells nicorette gumin the United States.This is the samedivision that in 2014Proposed banning 99% of thevapor products on the market.- It will ban more than 99.99%Of all e-cigarette productson the market today.- Over in california, statesenator leno was acceptingLarge campaign contributionsfrom big pharmaWhile at the same timeproposing regulationsAnd taxes on vapor products.- We are at risk oflosing 25 years effortAnd a two billiondollar investmentIn keeping a nextgeneration from becomingAddicted to the killingdrug of nicotine.We have information fromnot only the californiaDepartment of publichealth, which has declaredThese devices to bedangerous and unsafe.And they are currentlyin the midst of anEducational campaign.You may have seen some ofthe television commercialsThat are out right now.- yousmoke pack after packDay after day.♪ I'm back in baby's arms♪ I missed those lovin' arms- your day stays fresh.♪ I'm back where I belong♪ back in baby's arms- And then you're gonna hearfrom all the health advocacyGroups, the lung association,the heart association,The cancer societyAll those who arein the businessOf protecting public healthWill be speaking in support.- The american cancer societytook endorsement moneyFor nicotine patches and gumAnd then releasedofficial statementsWarning against vaping.- For disclosure, neither Inor smoke-free pennsylvaniaHas ever receivedany funding from anyTobacco company, fromany drug company,Or from any e-cigarette company.Most of the anti-tobaccomovement, thelarge organizationsFor the last 20 years, thecampaign for tobacco-free kids,The american cancer society,the american heart association,The american lung association,the american academyOf pediatrics, the americanmedical associationAnd many more have receivedhundreds of millionsOf dollars from thepharmaceutical companiesThat manufacture andmarket the nicotine gums,Lozenges and patchesAnd the chantix andwellbutrin medicines.For the last 10 years, theseorganizations have beenLobbying to ban allsmoke-free alternatives.And we know they startedwith smokeless tobacco,With snus, with dissolvables,With lozenges, the tobaccolozenges that came out.And then whene-cigarettes came outThe first thing they didwas urge the fda to ban themIn 2009.And the fda did.- When you have thiskind of a triage, okay.And then you have theseother people now feeding offThe tentacles, cancer, lung,heart, getting all this moneyFrom the government.Getting money from themaster tobacco settlement.What are they supposed to do?- With all the lobbying frombig charities, it looks likeGovernment took theconvenient opportunityTo protect theirtobacco profits.- The category is under threat.Countries likesingapore, thailand,Probably indonesia, australiaHave banned e-cigarettes.We just had a vaperfrom australia sayingShe's smoked for 43 years.She tried everything.Patches, gum, behavioraltherapy, the works.Didn't work.She heard about e-cigarettesand she asked her localPharmacist, can she havethat, she didn't have.Then she found the quit line.Could she have an e-cigarette.She's tried all the othermodalities of cessation.They said, "no, it's illegal."So that is sendingher to an early death.- Twenty countries havenow banned e-cigarettesThanks to, due to worldhealth organizationTelling them to.- In hong kong it'sa $12,000 fine.And/or up to two years in jail.In brunei, it's $10,000.This is happeningall over the worldWhere countries have banned,or heavily restricted vaping.- And you're doingnothing about smoking.So you're in a place whereyou can get cigarettesEverywhereBut you cannot get e-cigarettes.- By banning all theseleast hazardous alternativesThey're actually protectingcigarette markets.- A vaper...From dubai.He was telling me thathe had quit smokingTwo years ago with e-cigarettes.But, he was forced,By the government, dueto the ban, to illegallyIntroduce e-cigaretteproducts in the countryIn order for him tostay off cigarettes.So, you are forcing someoneto become, to do someIllegal actions in order tostay away from cigarettes.And I don't see any reasoningAnd any commonsense behind that.- In some countries youneed a prescription to vape.But you can go to thestore and buy cigarettes.In australia, they ban vapingliquids that have nicotineIn them because they saynicotine is a poison.Yet they sell nicotine gumright in convenience storesWithout any sortof prescription.- Then three black suvsRaided my house.They had a search warrant,a search and seizure warrant.And they came in and theywent through all my things.They bagged and taggedeverything they could findRelated to electroniccigarettes.And, yeah, theytook all my stuff.It was horrible, itwas a scene out of likeIt was like, it was likethey thought I was some sortOf columbian drug cartel,or something.They were alleging thatI breached an obscureTobacco control act, a lawThat said, it isillegal to sell productThat is not a tobacco productBut is designed toresemble a tobacco product.Um yeah.The law wasn't written toblock electronic cigarettes.The law was written toblock candy cigarettes,You know those littlewhite cigarettesWith the littlered ends on them.That's what the lawwas written for.And the health departmentwere trying to stretchThis law and thenuse it to blockThe lifesavingtechnology it was insane.But nonetheless, theytook all my thingsAnd I had to shutthe business down.It was horribleafter all the successAnd seeing the differenceI was making in so manyPeople's lives, to have itshut down and taken awayLike that was just,it was just horrible.I felt, I couldn't let this go.If I had given up atthat point in time,It was over.A precedent would have been setBanning the saleof these devices.I can't possiblyexplain what it's likeTo tell your family thatYou're gonna pushahead with this thingEven though it's probablygonna bankrupt you.But you're simply gonnado it because it'sThe right thing to do.And then at the end,after you do it allAnd you go through allof these sacrificesAnd all of this painAnd all the fightsand arguments,The court simplyignores the argumentAnd simply finds you guilty.The lives of millions ofaustralians and billionsOf people worldwidedon't appear to matterIn this situation.It seems to be about money.Somebody's got an agenda.And it isn't about us.Don't let the bastards win.I think that's all for now.- One of the biggestvaping news stories in 2015Was when portland stateuniversity came out with a studyShowing that there wasmore formaldehyde in vaporThan in cigarettes.- formaldehyde studybasically was a fraud.The person who did it...Set the pv on a wrong settingAnd it would dry puff,no vaper could use it.- All the way up to12, I'm not trying thisAll the way through.Wish me luck.It can't be done.- But they made amachine inhale it.And then they assumedthis machine would inhaleSo many, hundreds ofinhales every hourFor the rest of their lifeFor 75 years theyprojected it out to be.And they added upall these dry puffsOf the machine dry puffingfor 75 years in a row.And then said it mightbe more carcinogenicThan cigarette smoking.But, it was a fraud.A lot of these researchers,they're mostly fundedBy the federal government.The food and drug administrationAnd the department ofhealth and human servicesThrough the nationalinstitutes of healthAnd through the centersfor disease controlAre funding most of thepeople who are tryingTo ban e-cigarettes.And they're funding themto go out and lobby to banE-cigarettes.- Even though it'scompletely illegalThe cdc gave grants to thewashington state chapterOf the american lung associationWho used thatmoney for lobbying.This is what happened.- king five news.- For so many adults,this has been a lifeChanging intervention.- now at 6:30 aheated hearing in olympiaAs the state tries to becomethe first in the nationTo regulate e-cigaretteslike tobacco.Staff bureau chief drewnicholson looks at the proposalThat would makewashington's vaping lawsSome of the toughestin the country.- It's a violationof federal lawTo use federal fundingto lobby for laws.But it's been going on.The cdcs been warnedabout it by the departmentOf health and humaninspector general report.They had hearings infront of the us houseOf representatives, energy andcommerce committee on this.The tom freiden waswarned that he could notInsist in his grantsgiving out theState health departmentsthat they lobby for laws.He was putting it in the grapesAnd it's a violationof federal law.So this has been going on,this is why all these cities,Municipal health departments,and state health departmentDirectors have comeout calling for bans onE-cigarettes becausethey don't want to loseTheir cdc funding.And why these researcherskeep coming outEvery researcher thatcomes out and generatesA news story saying e-cigarettescontain toxic chemicalsGets another 10 milliondollar grant from the fdaOr the nationalinstitutes of health.- Nothing motivatespeople quite like fear.Especially when itinvolves their children.- You know this recentreport found nearlyTwo million middle schooland high school studentsHave tried electroniccigarettes, or e-cigarettes.That set off some alarmbells and this week40 state attorney'sgeneral called on the usFood and drug administrationto regulate these cigsJust like it regulates tobacco.- The federal healthagencies goalsWas hoping by year2020 that we could getThe past month smokingrate among youthDown to 16%.It's down below 10% now.Five years ahead of schedule.And it's becauseof e-cigarettes.- The regulatory authoritiesthen confused the waterBy saying, well,maybe it reduces harmBut maybe it doesn't.And we definitelyneed more research.But of course, we need moreresearch on everything.- What do you think,is it a questionAre they bad for you, orwe just still don't know?- I think what wecan say basically isThey might be or might notbe able to help you quit.But there are definiteharms that they can cause.And those definite harms arein different environments.So if they get kidshooked on nicotineThat's a really bad thing.- Virtually all thedaily users of teenagersAre either smokers, orpeople who used to smoke.And the problem is, theresearchers aren't disclosingA lot of this daily use data.So the only two surveyshave ever asked people,Did you vape nicotine,or no nicotine?And they found 96%of all non-smokersWho had ever used ane-cigarette in their lifeUsed no nicotine e-cigarettes.- You've called this deeplytroubling in the past.And, why?Well, if you startwith e-cigarettesThere's a real likelihoodthat you will becomeNicotine addicted.- So called gateway effectis used as a reason whyE-cigarettes should not be used.If children start withe-cigarettes that leadsAs a gateway to strongerdrugs and to smoking.There's no evidenceto back it up yet.- Just applying firstprinciples to it.If a product hasmainly only nicotineAnd another one hasnicotine and tarI don't think you need along-term 10 year study to sayThe former is definitely abetter choice for a smokerWho wants to quit,than the latter.- You don't think thatthey had somethingSo solid that vapingand e-cigs were deadlyAnd harmful, theformaldehyde, the carcinogens,The nico, the--it's all bullshit.- If you look atthe united kingdomE-cigarette users upto the end of last year70% of them thoughtthat e-cigarettesWere safer thanstandard cigarettes.That was their perception.And in the space of sixmonths, that's dropped downTo an perceptionrate of about 43%.So through the misinformation,bad scienceIt's hurt the category.- Let me ask about theother people who areAround people who maybe smoking e-cigarettes.Is the idea of secondhandsmoke, I mean we know aboutThat with cigarettes,but some researchers sayThe amount of potentialcarcinogens in the vaporPotentially is extremely minuteThat it's insignificant in fact.I mean, do youdisagree with that?- Well we don't know what'sin more than 200 differentE-cigarette products out there.What we do know isthat there is nicotine.- They should be accurateand responsible communicationOf the facts to the consumer.And such a responsible agencyWould need to weigh theirwords very carefully.- The dangers ofe-cigarettes are clear.Today's electroniccigarettes are no betterThan the joe camels of the past.- If all the smokersof cigarettes todaySwitched toe-cigarettes tomorrow,The billion liveswill definitely besignificantly reduced.- It's the smokingthat kills people.It's not the nicotine.People smoke for thenicotine, but they dieBecause they inhale smoke.- We have none ofthe tar, the smoke,Or the 4,000 plus chemicalsgoing into your body.- There's no evidencethat vaping has causedOr associated with any disease.And we know that it'shelped several millionPeople quit smoking.- So the billion livesthat we're trying to save,Better do a hell of a lotmore than we're doing nowBecause right now thearmy isn't big enough.A lot of people don't evenwant to fight the war anymoreBecause we're, it'san uphill battle.People are exhaustedand tired and frustratedAnd angry and pissed offAnd upset with the factthat we can't fix itBecause it's truthful,and it's right.- But things arenot looking good.- the numbers nowshow that e-cigarette salesAre down.- Europe just passedall kinds of rules.They're gonna take beneficialproducts off the shelvesAnd out of the livesof thousands of peopleWho are trying to quit smoking.- It will close down the marketFor the independents.It will hand a majoritycontrol to the tobacco industryWho are producing devices.And I think it willbe a damaging thingTo the whole of thevaping industry.I'm very disappointed inthe way things are going.- Here in poland we haveOver one million vapers.And we estimate thatAfter thatHeavy legislationIt will be 500,000,Not moreOr even, even less.We are trying to find a wayToFight.It's not easybecause ppds alreadyA law in the european union.- In the us the same thing.The fda just passedall kinds of new rulesThat will keep millionsof people smoking.- The fda has estimated that 90,More than 98.5%Of all e-cigaretteproducts on the marketWill be banned bytheir regulation.All e-liquid will be banned.This is not a proposedregulation to protect childrenAs the fda has presented itfalsely to the news media.It's prohibition plan b.- You know whatthe fda's gonna do,You know what eu's gonna do,You know whatgermany's gonna do,You know whatmalaysia's gonna do,You know what brazil's gonna do,You know whatargentina's gonna do.We all know, the die is cast,The cast is formed,the stage is setAnd the script is written.End of story.Why?Because nobody cares.- A billion lives.A billion lives, abillion people with names.They each have a name.And if you and I werein discussion with them,Would it not be fair andresponsible to provideThem with the right information?The question is, how muchevidence is sufficientFor that one personsitting in front of you?So if you the nurse, or thepharmacist, or the dentist,And it's your patient,and they ask you,"I'd like to use ane-cigarette, what's your view?"Then you can't say, "well,"we need to do more research."That's just not helpful.It's irresponsible.- The public needs to know thetruth about these products.- And they need public healthpeople telling the truthAbout the risks.At least 95% lessrisky than smoking.- If we look at thehistory of public health,The biggest breakthroughsare associated historicallyWith two reallyreally simple things.One, you give people enoughinformation that theyCan make an informeddecision aboutWhat they're gonna do.And two, you give themthe ability to actOn that information.- It's a crimeNot to tell the billion peopleWho will lose their lifeBecause they smoke,Of the alternative.- we are losing.We are losing fastand furious and bigAnd who's gonna lose?The smokers, again.Who are now tryingto transition overWhen they've been askedand begged and cried forFor years and years andnow we have somethingThat's viable, and we'renot giving it to them.It's just shameful.It's embarrassing.This is not how peopleshould treat other people.Especially under theguise of public healthAnd compassion andlove and libertyAnd freedom and allthat.You know, I'm sick of it.- What we have here isthat the best kept secretIn tobacco cessation,tobacco reductionIs the use of saferalternative nicotine products.And that consumersare denied that right.- We have this huge glaringopportunity to do somethingThat would sort of rivaleradication of small pox,Or dealing withcholera, sanitationIs one of the biggestpublic health breakthroughsWe've ever had.And it's staring us in the face.And it's notconceptually difficult.And we've got examplesof where it's workedAnd we look at thingslike swedish snus.We have proof of conceptthat people can getTheir nicotine in farless hazardous waysAnd be just fine with it.Uh, and it hasn't happened yet.- And I guess reallywhat prompted meTo want to quitWas seeing my uncleDying of lung cancer.And without a shadow of a doubtHe was the most genuineAnd kind-hearted personI've ever known in my life.- People are gonna die.People are gonna get sick.There are people who shouldhave had the opportunityTo grow old.To be part of theirgrandchildren's lives.I knew firsthand theexperience that I had hadAnd how dramatic thechange in my lifeAnd my health had been.I'd seen dozens offriends and family members,Actually hundreds, really,in the end of livesThat have been directly changedBy using these devices.And the health department,like that's their nameThe health departmentwere banning them.You can still buy cigarettes.You know, buy and use anytobacco product you likeBut you can't buythe alternativeThat we know issignificantly, I mean likeOver 95% safer.- And really Ijust, I didn't wantMy children to haveto see me that way.I wanted to beAble to be thereFor them more in the futureAnd extend my lifeFor them.And, essentially thatIs what vaping has done.Vaping has helped me toquit smoking cigarettes.And for that, I am thankful.- a billionlives are at stake.The status quo is winning.Smoking is strong.The battle rages oneven as you watch this.Big business and governmentare working togetherAll over the worldto serve the fewAt the expense of the many.We see so many examples.In our food system.Our medicine.And now we see it inthe push to preserveSmoking and its cash flow.To condemn a billionpeople to death.Billions of mourning kids.Billions of broken hearts.We can choose a better approach.We can end fear-mongering.We can help ourneighbors live better.We can help ourneighbors live longer.And we must.♪ I've heard a lot offunny stories and opinions♪ now to get thewhole thing straight♪ you can't keep abunch of hypocrites♪ and myers all fromshowing their face♪ but
