I think it's boring.Waking up early, homework,the worst is when they yell at you.The teachers?Yes, the teachers.They treat us asif we were stupid.Like we don't deserve their patience.Ignore them.People who don'tfeel sympathy are cowards.But my mothersays that school is important.Of course.That's what she was told.Then school is not important?Yes, but other thingsare important too.Like what?Like living,feeling...Ioving...thinking.Why did you breakinto my property?Don't you know it's forbidden?- By whom?- It's against the law.They put kids like you in jail.Why would they put me in jail?What did I do?Breaking into somebody'sproperty is nothing?But I didn't steal or break anything.So it doesn't matter thatyou broke into my house?Of course not.I just wanted to see you.Why do you keep on talking to meas if we were equals?You did the same thing.But I'm older.Older by age.When you grow up, you'll learn thatelders should be respected.What?Only because you're older?You're rightI was forgetting for a momentthat greatness doesn't come with age.How pathetic!To become what you fought against.I forgot that we lose the battlewhen we stop being ourselves.I used to fight to be ableto express myself.And now that I find...somebody fighting to be heard,I suppress him.I'm becoming that whichI fought against.Anyway, you'll understandwhen you're older.You'll see one day,when you reach my age...how it feels to realizewhat you have become.Well, now leave.Hey! Don't climb the wall!You're going to ruin it.How?

What happened?What did you see?Nothing much...A garden, an old house...and an old lady.It must be Norma's aunt then.No, man. Come on.There's nothing like that inside.But everybody says that it's scary.Scared, I was.But not because of any corpseor exorcist.Why don't you go back in thereand look for the exorcist inside?Oh please, man.Yes, I'd go back but not to lookfor your exorcists...or anything weird.Sorry.As soon as I can.Honey, your son.Hi, baby.I didn't hear you come in.Don't call me "baby".This is my... my boss.Well, a friend at work, Armando.I wanted him to meet you...so you could see how...Did you make anything to eat?I didn't have time,but what do you say...the three of usgo out for tacos?He likes them.

You don't get it!When are you going to learn, Jorge?When are you going to learnto shut up.Jorge, listen to me...And you, Mom...have you ever listened to me?Jorge del Pino, stand up please.What did you learn during yourlittle week of vacation?Did you learn anything aboutthe famous authors of Mexico?Yes, I did, I learned a lot.Ah, yes?Like what?I learned that Diego Rivera wasa very thoughtful man...he wouldn't hesitate for a moment...to give a friend a beautifulrosebush for her garden.I learned that JoseVasconcelos was a naive man...he didn't realize that his people...preferred food to books like"The Odyssey" or "The Iliad".I also learned that Gabriela Mistralknew how to be a friend.That New York is as beautifulas any other city.But Paris... Paris is themost beautiful city in the world.And only one woman was able to...meet and befriend this group of men...women and artists.But the most important thing I learned...was that I don't need anybodyor anything to be happy...and to know who I really am.That's what I learned.Is there anything elseyou want to know?Where did you get all that stuffyou told the teacher?I didn't invent it.I'm not like you.Where did you get it from?It's the lady from the big house,she taught me everything.You still see her?Of course.In fact, I'm going now.Do you want to come?No, no, thank you.I have a lot of homework to do.Homework, man?We don't have any homework.Well, I have to start studyingfor tomorrow's lesson.Yeah... right.Fuck off.Don't talk to your daddy that way.I'm leaving.How come you like to visit her?Don't you get bored?No.Why do you go?I don't know.She's like the grandmotherI never had.Me?Your grandmother?I'd shoot myself first.Seriously.I never wanted children,forget about grandchildren.- You never got married?- I didn't say that.I said I never had children.Why didn't you want to have kids?Because...some people are difficult.Well, it's not that I wouldn'thave wanted kids.It's just that I wouldn'thave made them happy.Why?Because I wasn't happy.And...are you happy now?In this moment, I am.What did you do?About what?Work?I used to write.Where?In a notebook, wherever.I understand that.What, for a newspaper, a magazine?I don't want to talk about that.How did you buy this house?It's must have been prettywhen it was new.Very pretty.It was a gift.From whom?Let's leave it at that.Who was it, a friend,did you get along?It was his way of telling mehe loved me.Did you have friends thatwere writers, like you?They weren't writers.They were artists.One of them was Dali.He was very funny.He was a great man.BuÒuel...BuÒuel was written in capital letters.He was an incredible man.You never knew whether he wasjoking or being serious.And where are they now?Dali is in Spain.And BuÒuel unfortunately, is in heaven.Why did you stop seeing them?Ah, fame.- Fame?- Yes.They became very famous.Dali making portraits of himselffor the journalists.Fame overwhelmed everybody,some even believed in it.And what happened to the others?We grew apart.It always happens.The first time, it happenedto me here in Mexico.Then I went to Spain looking fora group of intellectuals...and a few years laterthe same thing happened.Then, I went to Franceand the same thing.Everybody falls for fame.Everybody.That's why I ran away from it.You... were you famous?Dummy, didn't I just tell you thatI ran away from it?Why do you say thatfame is dangerous?Because you start believing in it.People and the pressapplaud the character.Not the person.They applaud the artist.And the artist, my boy,is only a character.They only care if you'reimportant and famous.They don't care who you really are.They say they love and admire you.But if ever you shouldneed anybody because you're ill...or just need companywhen you're alone...they would never be there.Because in the endthey don't care about you.They only care what you represent.That's why you can nevermake a mistake...because they would neverforgive you for it.They will never treat you...like a real person.That was what my friendsnever understood.You never wanted to be famous?No, I was never interested.Now go home.I don't want you getting in troublewith your mother.No. Don't worry.Tell me more about... Doli?What was it?About BuÒuelos...Tell me about him. Yes, yes...Is it true that New Yorkis full of skyscrapers?Tell me more... I won't haveproblems with my mother.Yes, come on...Are you all right?Are you all right?Are you in pain?I wouldn't have actedlike that if I weren't.Tell me what's wrong.Only a few bruisesI have from last week.Really?Yes.Don't worry.Don't start with me.No.Easter week is not possible.Mother, I haven't had timeto go to Queretaro.We're both very upset and I don'twant to say anything we'll both regret.Call you later, bye.Where were you?Why were you fightingwith grandma?She wants us to goto Queretaro for the holidays.As if I were at her beck and call.She's crazy.I already made plans.With whom?Your boyfriend?Don't be so rude.I'm your mother.Please, Mom.Did you notice the wayyou were talking to yours?Actually I was thinking thatyou should go alone.Me?Where?Queretaro.What am I going to do there?Don't be a bad grandson.My mother wants to see you.What for?So she can give me rotten candyand walk me like a dog?Don't be like that.She really wants to see you.You don't think you haveobligations with your family?Only when you needmoney or toys.But of your own free will never.How selfish!Hello?Hi.Yes.Yes.Hold on.Go to your room!Yes, at what time?Which one?
