            In August, Flies Are Fat.That's how my brother Harisnamed his book.The book touches upon all matters:9/11, Gandhi, global warming...The accompanying DVDincludes scenes from our vacation.I'll read you an extract."Did you ever wonderwhat makes a novel a best seller?"Maybe, a story based on real facts.""Yet, Galileo got into troubleproving the heliocentric theory....."because his society wasn't readyfor this kind of truth.""Could it be that a book's success liesin the consumer, and not the writer?"I'm like all Nobel winnersbefore getting awarded.



They had nothing, just like me!My brother is treated byDr. Maria Giannakoudakis.She was with you at the beach.Yes...Maria Giannakoudakis,the psychiatrist.However, there was alsosome Petra Hiphelsbach.Himmelsbach!HiIeIsbach...Himmelsbach!Himmelsbach!Way to go!Hildegard... Just a moment...Your honor, she speaks Greek well.It would make it easier for us,if you don't mind...



Proceed.Hildegard, will you speak in Greek?You master the language, shall we try?We zaII try.Marvellous! So, at the beach,there was also some Petra HiIesbach.You can accessthis beach only by boat.Also, nobody goes to zis island.Harry's the only one who knows it.50, Maria had to come vith usand ve told Haris's wife......she vas a friend of minefrom Germany.Maria Giannakoudakisis Petra Himmelsbach.-Maria can speak German?-No...How could she then passfor a German?Ze pretended to be deaf-mute!What language do you speakwith your brother?Greek...Haris doesn't speak German.How come?We are half siblings.Our father was Greek.My mother is German,Haris's is Greek.Haris is Greek, I'm half Greek......but mostly German'cause I grew up there.Let's make a brief recap toprevent misunderstandings, ok?Well...It was on an August morning...A BEE IN AUGUSTManolis, pick us up at around 5.Tell you mom to havethe mackerels ready.Vasso, it's been 4 days now,we have been eating only mackerels!We're like Captain Cousteau's crew!-But they're fresh!So were Cousteau's fish! Butthey ate marinara for a change.Even sailors get sick of fish,I'm just a writer!Mackerels are off!-But I told the poor woman.You should have asked me, too!Hilda, mackerels again?Petra, do you want to eat fish?See? Nobody wants fish.Petra doesn't count.She is eating like a bird.I can't believe thatdeaf-mutes can actually live.I mean, I get dizzywhen my ears get clogged.Her ears are not clogged...She was born this way.Well, just forget it...I'm going for a svim.Me too...Will you join me?No, I'll come in a bit...-Want me to wait for you?-Go ahead and I'll follow...Ok then, I'll wait for you.-Why don't you go?-Do you mind me waiting?Why should I mind?I'm getting into the water.So, Haris,are you having a good time?No, I'm a little bit stressed out.-I don't see why.-What?-You don't seem stressed out.-Let me be the judge of that.Right...What are stressed out about?Can we talk? When Vasso returns,I have to become a deaf-mute again!It was your ideato be a deaf-mute.Would you prefer meto chitchat with your wife?-Do you think it's better now?-It's just great!Yeah, right. Look at this...Sunscreen, grass,the" American Idol" CD......like a teen's holiday.- Haris, quit it!I quitted everything, dear.I quitted drinking, smoking...Like Kazantzakis' quote......"I fear nothing,I hope for nothing, I am free".Because he had confusedfreedom with depression!Why didn't you let mego to Thassos?Go where? To Thassos?With Klapanaras?Was I in your way?I just askedwhy you didn't let me go.-Are you serious?-You think it's better here?Why? Don't you like it here?-The beach is nice...-Don't you like the village?-It's just one nice village.-Did I say there were two of them?-And you've been coming 4 years now?-Mano|is is from this village.Vasso tutors himduring winter, for free......so we come herein the summer, you know...You really pissed me off...Why?About Thassos.Why do you want to go there?To visit the island!I've never been there.You didn't give a shit about Thassos'til he invited you, right?I can't understandwhy you are crazy about him.-Who, me?-Seems like it...Is it because he's got money?Yeah, black money! I knowall about tax evasions myself.They rip off state funds andthen they pose for the camera.Mr. Klapanaras is nowa bright business man......a celebrity, as if!Why are you stressed out?-Because of my book.-Why? It will be a success.-You really think so?-I think you're talented......but you must be worsethan what I think.You have 2 conflicting ideasof me at the same time?I have idolized youbecause I am in love.When this is over,I'll know what you're worth.I see... Then, I won't care aboutwhat you think.If you do that,you'll be a real prick!Vasso's opinionis more important?-What's up with you now?-No, you listen!Because I pretend to be mute,it doesn't mean I am!When will she stop?Don't you love me?Easy, honey,she can see us.So what? I am a deaf-muteand I got dizzy.Maria, please...Love, I beg you to stop...When I say please, I mean it!What do you want?Stop begging,you're making a fool of yourself.What's wrong now?-Put some lotion on my back.-How? What if she sees us?You'll tell her you helped me'cause I couldn't do it.I see you have itall planned out.Move your hand.You think Vasso is stupid.She's nice, not stupid.-What's the difference?She'll go to heaven anyway,but I'll go to hell.That leaves no placefor me to go then.Why you don't break up with me?Because I love you.I don't know how I do it.I'm good at making relationships......but I just can't tell the otherthat I want to break up.If you really want it,you can do it.Yes, but I never wantedto break up with nobody.Unless they wanted to hurt me.I can't divorce Vasso, either.She really loves me.Do you love her?Yes, I really do.Fine. Then, whydon't you break up with me?Because I love you...Is the deaf-mute hittingon you or what?-Are you serious, Vasso?-Why is she still here then?You think this meansshe's hitting on me?Of course! She'll follow youinto the water as we‚Äù, try her.-Vasso, I'm not in the mood.-Go into the water, I say!-Why don't you get lost?-You're chicken?-Enough with that crap!-You're chicken.-Who's chicken?-You, 'cause I'm right.You say, if I go into the sea,Petra will follow me.Should I go straight inor dive off the rocks?I don't care!If she won't follow.......I'll let you do me!Jesus!Maria, have you lost it?As if I would let you screw her!Why are you laughing?It seems funny, now.What seems funny?That we were pretending,that I freaked out, all of it.Picture Haris having sexin sign language!He would kill her!Do you think Haris is capableof killing somebody?Everyone is capable of killing......everyone, but Haris.-How can you be so sure?It'd be like Maria Teressabecoming a terrorist!You had to see himwhen he was stung by a bee.He swells up terribly!-God Damn!-What's wrong, dear?A bee is after me!Why is it after you?I forgot to ask!I saw it and I dove to escape......but it was waiting for me.-Why did you come out?To smell the roses!Even dolphins come out for air!-Where's the cortisone?-Why?You know thatif it stings me I'll swell up.The doctor said to carrycortisone always with me.Come on, where is it?-Ok, I'll look for it in a bit.-You forgot where you put it?I don't rememberif I took it with me.-What?-Stop shouting!Are you serious? I'll die!-I have many things on my mind.-But you always bring toilet paper!Mercy! I just forgot one thing!See? She saysshe is trying to kill me!You can be such an ass sometimes.It's official,I forgot the cortisone.Don't be scared, you wimp!I'm not a wimp!Don't move! It'll go avay.No, it got tangled in the towel.Haris, vhat's wrong?This shitty bee stung me!It was clear it didn't like me.Is it five yet?-Yes! It's twenty to eleven.-I start to flare up.-It's fine, relax.It's 10:40, my name is Harisand I'm allergic...Guys, I'm transforming!-We should pee on you.-Or just shoot me.Go into the water,it'll do you good.Sting's out!What are we going to do?He's going to swell up.Where's my cell phone?-Shit, no signal! Yours?- I forgot it in the room.Haris forgot his as well!Does Petra have a cell phone?Of course!But, how can she use it?She communicatesthrough text messages!Great! What's her operator?It's not Cosmote!But zis phonehasn't got signal either.This means that112 is not available.-Why?-To dial 112......you must have accessto at least one operator......who's going to allowonly emergency calls.Did we have to choose Robinson'sisland for a fucking swim?Sea's iodine and crap!How can iodinedo me any good now?I don't believe my eyes!I was the black swanand became swan's lake!It's... nothing...Nothing at all...Manolis will come andyou'll get your cortisone...By then, I will mostprobably need only formaldehyde!Petra is trying to say something?How many words?Right, she both mute and German.I don't believe it!Quit that slapping!Seven words?I won't find it, period!Is there an article?No article? We're screwed!Sea weed. Sea weed?She's describing the buoy!The sea?-All of us?-Everybody in the water?Front crawl!Backstroke!- She'll go there on foot.- Get serious!Swimming?-Swimming.Petra will swim...back to the island......to visit the church!An ass?No, she's swimming to Myconos!Drugs...She'll quit taking drugs.-Will you cut the crap?Stop, I found it."The big blue"!By Luc Besson.Zink straight!Why are the Germans attacking us?Vasso, shut up!Nize, very nize!Petra will bring a doctorto give you the shot.Where from?The village is 3 miles away!Not even Johnny Weissmullercould swim that far!I got it! She'll swimonly with one hand......holding the cell phonewith her free hand......and call once it regains signal!What a great plan!Right, but how willshe talk on the phone?Of course, mute peoplecan't talk, right?Then I'll go.Give me a cell phone.No, I'll just take mine.-Hurry!Hurry... It's spreading.- Don't worry, I'll save you.Save me! Call my nameand save me from the dark!Hurry up!What you want these for?-I swim only with flippers on.Go! Go! Good luck.Don't be scared, you wimp!I'm not a wimp!Hilda, will you stop itwith the video-camera?You're just like Michael Moore.-Vhat's wrong, Haris?Give me a break! I can'tbe perfect all the time!-Calm down, love.-I am human, too!She dared call me a wimp!-Wimp is better that chicken.Let him be. At firsthe was afraid and petrified......now he grows strongand learns how to carry on.Stop scratzing,you'll make it vorse!-Can it get any worse?-She's right, stop it.Are you tripping?I feel weedy and sick!Look at her! I said weedyand she remembered her weed!- You think I don't give a shit?- Go to hell!Zis anxiety onlymakes things vorse.Right, keeping calmis a life saver.You're a doctor, don't you carryvith you anything that could help him?I wasn't prepared for an isle.He should have known better.I thought Vassowould bring the cortisone.Only Sissies care about that stuff.But you're a real manwith a harem!Sadly, I don't seeany good coming out of it.-It's my fault that I came.-You should have gone to Thassos.You don't belong to the isle.You should be with Klapanaras!-Have you lost it?-With Klapanaras, I say!Just what I wanted to say!-This tourist needs help?-ViII you stop?It's important to seewhere we go from here.Stop scratching!-I can't help it.-Should we tie him up?-I prefer Chinese torture.He feels itchybecause of the salt.If we rinse it off,he'll feel better.But who's going to get the water?-Me!You think that's enough?- Is that all the water we've got?- We'll have more at five o'clock!Guys!I want to drink something first,my mouth's dry.We should save somefor Vasso, too.She forgot the cortisoneso I'll have her share.-No, she went to get help.-Bring it back!We'll save up some for her.If she dehydrates,2 sick people are really bad news.You listen? This issober German thinking.You're emotional and full of crap.You should never see Vasso sick.When she was admittedat the clinic...Why was she admittedat the "climic"?-She was a regular visitor.-I didn't know.-I've told you about the abortions.-What did she do at the "climic"?She had her hair done!An abortion, of course!Go on, laugh!She had 5 abortions.At 17, 19...Then we broke up...But we got back togetherat her birthday...She had her 3rd at 20, yes...And the 4th at 28...That's weird... He's all swollen upbut for his Johnny!Dear, I love your little Johnny!He's the man!Then, she hadher symphysis operated.Couldn't she seeyou didn't want a child?She didn't want one, not me!I've always wanted a child......even now, that I'm 40.-Now, stick to the symphysis.I want a child from you.Really?You've never told me that.-Will you let me speak?-In front of Hilda?It's ok,we made peace with Germany.Did you have to tell me nowthat you're dying?That way,you'll always remember him.Am I dying?Guys, I'm not feeling really well.No, I was joking, you wimp.I'm not a wimp!Haris, vhy don't you tell usabout Vasso and the "climic".Give me a break."Climic" and crap!The clinic echoed with her shouts.She's really difficult.She was cursing and hitting me.I relaxed when they took her in.I dare say that during the operation,I thought that if she died......I would finally find peaceof mind. Can you believe it?And I'm with her sincewe were teenagers.I thought she hadto die to be free.I waited 20 days...Take the cap......and I wanted to askfor a divorce.But then...-Then...Then, nothing.Nothing. Nothing, indeed.How do you know?-I am a psychic!You know how many timesI said to myself 'Divorce her'?-That's the problem.-What?That you're an introvert!You don't open up to your wife.See, she thinks you love her!- You think I don't love her?-Are you asking me?-Why not?Why don't you ask Hilda?I'm emotional, I might saysomething silly.-Don't I love Vasso?-Can't you see......that you are makinga fool of yourself?Why don't you get lost? Bitches!It's all my fault.I shouldn't confide in you.Confide in Vasso for a change.Where the hell is she?Did you wonderif she loves you back?Of course!She forgot the cortisone.How could she forget it?She's really inconsiderate.Then why doesn't shedivorce you?She's afraid that I mightbe happy without her.-Aren't you afraid of that as well?-Be afraid of my happiness?I mean, you're afraidshe'll also be happy without you.That she'll think she wasted her yearsand should have divorced earlier.All these can happen onlyif she falls in love with someone.A woman in love will dowhatever it takes.-Don't be 20 sure of that.-I am! Men are different.They meet their responsibilities.Stop laughing, stop it now!Let me rephrase.Say, I'm a ship-ownerand I love my yacht.I won't wreck my other shipsbecause of that. It's a crime.I would destroy so many people.- Hail Captain Haris!I'm glad he didn't shout "ahoy"when we first screwed.Enough, "Vasso I"sails back to harbor.I did my best, I reachedthe yellow buoy we saw earlier.-You managed to swim that far?-Yes, I'm beat.Well? Was thereany signal or just crap?-Just crap...-I knew it!To make it worse,I got so exhausted......that I plungedthe cell phone in the sea.It's useless now...-You think it matters?My death is a minor detail?- I'll remove the SIM card.There's no signal, I said!Sweet Mary Jesus!Yes, of course... We mayhave access to her operator.Indeed... Although I doubt it.Give-me-your-cell-phone. . .To-have-a-go-with-it-as-well .Vasso, you're spelling in Greekto a German deaf-mute?Vazo, I'll go.You're tired.-No!-Vhy don't you let me?I'll go just because...it's got to be me.Do you want to wreckall of our cell phones?I know how to do it now,I thought about it as I swam back.-You're just like your mother!-Stop nagging, it's simple.The band will hold the phone,I'll swim with both hands......and I'll stopto check for signal.-Vhy can't I go then?-I said no!That's weird...She left as soon as she came.See, Haris? She's doingeverything to help you.The itching's back?-My future seems really dark.-You stayed under the sun too long.-Where are you taking me?I don't believe it...Come on... The sun'IIcome out tomorrow!Stop scratching.-I can't help it!Stop it, I said!The ZIM card's not wet.Maybe I can save the phone, too.She saves the phonefrom drowning......and I'm doomedby a grouchy bee!My cell phone had signal,I saw it on our way here.She's get help.-You're sure ?Yes! There was signaleven after the buoy.Manolis will come to pick us up.-Cross my fingers.Look at this! I'm just likethe "Dude" Lebowski!-Are you ok?-Yeah, yeah, yeah...-I'm going for a swim.-Vait for me.Vait up!Inconsiderate cows!Haris, are you statingthe real facts?It's a bit difficult...See, the facts cannot be altered.People just experiencethe truth from different aspects.Someone can be two people.Or, two people can be one...Laurel and Hardy,in the package of one!-When did this begin?-Many years ago...But I didn't know it......because they neverboth surfaced at the same time.But during these critical momentsfollowing the bee sting......the truth is thatwe both shared the same stage.Gotcha!-Are you still feeling itchy?-Yes, but do enjoy yourselves!I don't wantto spoil your vacation!Don't get angry,we needed to refresh a bit.We must keep calm.You shrouded meand went for a swim.Even nurses in morguesare more sensitive.Haris, relax.The bee did you wrong, not us.Next time you see me eat honey......don't show pity.Isn't it unfair?We were 4 and the bee stungthe only one who's allergic!Nature cannot be unfair.Don't take it personally.A bee stung you,that's it! The end!And then I flared upand died, the end!Don't cry in my burial.Don't take it personally.-Haris, you von't die.-You swear?I swear to you,my snicker doodle.-You don't count.-Why?-Because you have idolized me.-Her medical skills don't count?Not at all. Which doctor says,"I swear, my snicker doodle"?You fool, by now you'd be deadfrom shock or suffocation.What about the swelling?Result of vascular dilation due tohistamine release in the blood.You don't evenknow the basics!- You mean, I'll live?- Yes!Really?-Why didn't you tell me?-'Cause I was deaf-mute.And now "she speaks"?She's about to go on muteagain because Willy's back.Well? Did you regain signal?I did...50? Will they pick upthe Little Drummer Boy?I don't think so...But why?With whom did you talk to?With no-one.Then what about that damn signal?-Vasso, what happened?-Vhat's wrong?I see...I'll die here...Serves you right!For what you did to me.You're dead for me.-What did I do?- Why do you have to die?- Relax, I'm not dead yet.I didn't mean it...It happened by mistake...What happened, what?I dialled 112to save you, my love.I mistakenly dialled 122......the answering machinewas activated and I heard you......in her messages. You talkedto her like it was me.I was so stupid to askif you were talking to me...Vasso, I love you.You're the only one I love.You don't love me...Why don't you love me anymore?You don't love me...Why don't you love me anymore?Who told you I don't love you?Who told you that?Tell me you were pretending...Right? Tell me!You're not feeling well?-Maria, now what?-Her name is not Petra?If his pressure drops, we loose him.You're the Manson's family!Stop it, you weasel!"Psychiatrist for deaf-mutes".Calm down. Now, the only thingthat matterz iz Haris.Then, you can talkeverything through.Maria is truly a doctor.Anyway, she was a brilliantMarlee Matlin!"Co-smo-te" and crap! Youshould be ashamed of yourselves.That's a whole different story.Now, Haris comes first.-She dares to talk back!-Shut up 'cause you'll regret it.Will you punch me?Should I be afraid of a pothead?-Tell her to shut up.-No, you shut it!Like you did these past days.Your mouth I mean......because you hadeverything else wide open!Will you stop? You heardmy messages "by mistake", you say.It was truly a mistake.I dialled 122 instead of 112.-Why did you call 112?-The indication was only for 112.Then, you wouldhave called only 112!You couldn't dial 122.Save this shit for someone else.You only cared about my messages!Where's my phone?I threw it away, of course...Men are real suckers.They fall for one tear.We knew it all and lurkedfor your performance.And you dared call meMarlee Matlin!How nosey! Nosey Parker!This man's dyingand you want to finish him.Is he gets hurt,I'll report you to the cops!Are you talking to compensateyour 3 days of silence?What will you befor the cops, Petra or Maria?Haris, how are you feeling?I feel dizzy, you guys...Really dizzy...What time is it?Is Manolis here yet?He's not here yet but...He's coming any minute now...How are you feeling?-Weird...-Do you realise you fainted?-Who?Me?When did I faint?Haris, what's up with you?I don't feel all that good.I don't feel all that good."Night had fallen...""and the moon had risenand flooded with light the sea.""We moved to the rock,expecting Manolis.""I was surroundedby my most cherished ones.""However, never before haveI felt so deep into my skin...""...the utmost loneliness."Leave that part, it's nonsense.True loneliness iswhen no-one notices you.But everybody was into me.Vasso was involved andshe would find out about it.But where was this fat dudehiding all these years?The truth is...That I've never been well.I met Maria for a reason.I wanted to get therapy.I could feel the fat guy coming.I felt him eversince I was little.Maria says he representsthe suppressed anger for my father.How silly! My fatherwas like all other dads.My mother indeedgot angry at him......because he went to Germanyto "bring back our money".As if he had forgotten itsomewhere in Dusseldorf......and went back to get it.He stayed there 3 years.I guess he worked for 'Siemens'......because he sent a refrigerator.Cutting-edge technology.Dad couldn't beaway from his family......so he starteda new one there.Families became twobut the salary was still one.Then, Siemens down sized...Yet, my dad was optimistic......and told his German familyhe'd bring their money from Greece.We were so happy!"Dad came back!"In Germany, they were sad."Dad's gone".His stress caused him asthma.He was torn betweenGermany and Greece.He always felthe was at the wrong place.He found peaceonly in Zagreb.He stopped there every 2 yearsand had 30 minutes to himself.When did you meet Hildegard?On August '83, in Korinthos...During summer......dad wantedto be around all of us.So, he broughtthe Germans to Loutraki.His leave was 1 month,but nobody knew.He was a train driver.Every second night......he slept away from home.He had bought a motorbike......and commutedfrom Loutraki to Athens.Until the dayhe had an accident.At the hospital,they notified both families.That's how I met Hilda,who cried for her dad......who was mine as well.I had no time to grief his death.In a flash, I became a guardian.Besides my mother, I hadto protect my little sister......who came into my lifeas a "latent love at first sight".One year later, I took herto Kithnos on a holiday.I met Vasso there,we hooked up......and there was real drama!My little Hildaturned into a woman.She got drunk on beerand sang German songs.Ever since, we have spentall our 20 summers together.During winter,Hilda lives in Dusseldorf.That's how I became a writer.20 years of corresponding!We beat even Tolstoy'svolume of writing!At first, she didn't speak Greekand had my letters translated.That was one deep love...She picked my best letters andpublished them under the title......"Meine Liebe Schwester",dear little sister.I became famous in Germanybefore I knew it!This is too much evenfor someone down-to-earth.After my 3rd discourseas a writer......I concluded thatanyone can be an artist.You just need to expose yourselfto the public with audacity.-You need to be talented, however...-No, just fearless.Or really-really scared.Fearless and scared peoplehave a common ground.The same weird behaviour.In your book, you sayyou became two people.It's not only you.-The others saw just one person.They saw one confused person.But I knew I had company.Maria says I want to completemy dad's unfinished job.To have it both ways.I refuse to decide andthis keeps popping in front of me.The man I'm seeingrepresents my problem.All men carry a burden......for me, it had to bea fat guy! It's cool.Is Manolis here?Let's go on board!I've got bad news.It's 9:30 and still no sign of him.Why did you let me sleep?Me? You forgotwe both fainted?Reason comes firstand then, panic prevails.-You know we're dying?-Yes, big loss for humanity.I don't want to die,I love my life.Don't panic, but you muststart loving death, too.It's decided, then?I'm going to Hell?Yeah! Life has beena real Paradise, right?You should pray to go to Hell.In Heaven, girls are serious.Good, I get wildonly with ass-shaking.Did Maria do any ass-shaking?You went to her for therapy.She'll lose her jobif this comes out.You went therefor therapy, not me!You wanted to get rid of me.You shouldn't lie to me.There's just the two of me!I admit it.I wanted to get rid of you.I won't ask you why. ButI never wished the same for you.I must say that you didreally good work with Maria.At first, I couldn't evencome through the door.When you hadthe perfect stage set......I'm sure you performedthe "snicker doodle show".What? I "performedthe snicker doodle"?-Don't deny it.-Why was it me?It couldn't be me.I was not there.The only time I came,I saw you kissing.I heard her saying, "I want usto marry, snicker doodle".And then you freaked outand left me to finish the job.You think I've forgotten?-I do love Maria.-Then you should marry her.Of course I would,if I could get rid of you.What's your problem with me?Why do you want me to die?Don't cry!I'm tired of feelingsorry for myself!You're obsolete andyou drag me down, understand?Vasso knows everything,happy now? Look at her.She's sleepingfor the past 2 hours.You think she's dead?Dead and crap.How can she sleep?She's escaping reality that way.She's sleeping becausenothing is going to change.But she's not the onewho tries to escape reality.I wonder what you seein that pothead...When I met her, she didn't smokeor drink, she had her patients...By the way, the world'sfull of crazy people.-Indeed...-Things are worse.In the old days,there was "the village idiot".Now, it's "the apartment idiot".Anyway...-How do you know all this?-The whole building visited Maria.They wentwith their slippers on...Had I not knownshe were a psychiatrist......I'd take herfor the janitor!That's whyshe fell in love with me.'Cause I lived in another building.I was like an exotic beauty.Why did we fall in love with her?Because she's like a baby.Right, Rosemary's baby.She thoughtshe had all the answers.She was really goodwith her patients.But she knew nothingabout herself.She was vulnerablefrom day one.And 1, instead of saving myself,I found a partner in crime.That's why I love her, you see...-Love of my life, you're up?-Yes, for some time now.-What are you doing all alone?-I'm thinking.I talk to myself.What you two talk about?You want me to join you?- She's joking with us!- Well, snicker doodle?Hello, snicker doodle!Why isn't Manolis here yet?-Why isn't Manolis here yet?-I don't know...I'm thirsty.-I'm thirsty.-Me too. Has the itching stopped?Shit!
