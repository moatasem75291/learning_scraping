Like you.And I...I prefer the guilt...I feel for that......to the life I haduntil this day.Growing up, no one had told memy life would be like this.That this is what it would be.Today...I pray......for a life,if not less vain......at least, less painful.Thanks for listening.I swear...... to be faithfulto my country.To obey the Constitution...... the laws and thelegislation of the nation.Submission to my superiors...... to perform theircommands promptly...... and without contradiction.- Something stuck in your throat, boy?- No.So, why are you stuttering?I officially proclaim,I have no excuse.Tie your shoelaces!- I'll do it!- No, mom, no!Fuck the Greek Navy!Fuck the State!Humiliationand degradation!Fucked all over!To the last dropof my sperm!You are nothingbut a burden.That's whatyou've become.It's 65.000 Euros to the bankand another 100.000 to the tax-office.That's what we owe.That's mom's legacy.And the only thingyou know how to do......when you do come with me,is cause trouble......and destroy everythingI try to build.Because you thinkyou understand.That's what you are!Someone who thinks he understands,something he does not understand.And lets everythinggo on and on. With me...With mom, with Gogo,with everything.Because you love us.Because you're kind.Because that's how you feel.Or because you're justplain stupid.A stupid old man, who doesn't knowwhat he's doing or where he's going.So...We don't carehow you feel.We don't carewhat you think.You'll goto the country house.You'll take your pension, your booksand go to the country house.And you'll stay there.I'll have my baby and I'lltake care of everything myself.And when it's needed,you'll simply help me.Are you awake?- Where to?- Athens.Will you love me forever?I will love you forever.More than anyone?More than anyone.No matter what?Yes.
