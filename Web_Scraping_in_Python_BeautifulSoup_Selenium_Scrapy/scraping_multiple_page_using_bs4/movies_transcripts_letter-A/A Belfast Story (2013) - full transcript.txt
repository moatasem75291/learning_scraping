This time better.They flew in in jets,talked up a ceasefireand told usthat it was all over now.The past is in the past.Let it sleep.This is Belfast,and this is a Belfast story.Lost years.And it still echoes.Right this way, sir.Chief Constable wantedto brief you personally,about the scene.Mistake dug this houseyears ago.So many cold rainy nights.Always. Always raining.This way, sir.Ah, James.- So glad you could make it.- Mm.Come inside.- You too, um...- Damien, sir.What we have hereis a gruesome motiveless murderof an old pensioner,to make matters worse.Pardon, sir,but this address has history.Well, yes, a connectionwas never provenso we'll have to leave that.We wouldn't wantto start the presson political bias again,would we?And the important thingis you applyall your undoubted skillsto find the killerand dealing with anyof the intricaciesthis case may present.Now I see why I've beenplucked off the scrap heap.The problem has raisedit's ugly head, eh?And the motives go way back.Deep.And that got said, you needsomeone for damage control.Someone is aboutto disappear anyway.Someone about to retire.Someone like me.You know what your problem is,James?You have exactly the wrong kindof intelligence.You're too cleverjust to take orders.You have to look behind them.But then you're not smart enoughto benefit from your knowledge.No wonder you're the lastof your stubborn kind.Still, I know you'll doa splendid job.Show us around then, Damien.Body was found upstairs.And neighbors reportedan explosionat approximately 4 a.m.It was in an empty room ona chair surrounded by needles.Messy.Very messy.I'll find him.Show James the lead, Damien.In the unused bedroom,a great deal of moneywas found and a note.And it read,"Official receipt for expenses.Two-hundred and fifty thousandpounds removedfrom known criminal revenue."And scrawled below itwas the word justice.Did you count the rest?Five hundred thousand poundsremain.Well, you can add thatto your sob story then.They took a thirdof his pension.I'm gonna leave youto get on with your work, James.I'm assigning Damien hereto assist youwith any leg workor paper filing.Any resources you need,consider them yours.I have to be away.I have a small speechto prepare.There was two of them.How do you know?A lot of nailsto carry up the stairsand one of them had to watchyour manwhile the other dugthe money out.Could that havebeen done afterwards?After the explosion?You don't hang aroundafter a bang like that.They crouched in the garden,waiting for something.My guess isthe old man got up brightand early.They were waiting for a light.What makes you thinkhe was awake when they came?The bed sheets weren't ruffled.Nobody was draggedout of that bed.No.They waited for a lightand they melted the boltand charged up the stairs.Then what happened?They tied him to the chair.Tied?Aye.Why else would he have beenso close to the blast?It also fitsthe executionary style.Near the nail bolt.That was his weapon of choiceback in the day.These boys were sendinga message.After that, the money?Aye.One of themwould have stood over him,while the otherwent to look for the money.What kind of justice is that?This is Belfast.Sir?Are you coming?I'm sorry, sir.It's just that you need to knowthere's been a murder.I've just taken the call.An elderly IRA veteranwas killed in his home.It was a bomb.Oh, not now.The Chief Constable sayshe'll sit on itfor as long as he can.I just can't help him again.We've suffered enough.I thought you'd want to knowright away.Of course.We must reassure the peoplethat no matter whatthe consequence,we are not going backwards.I'm building on a foundationof peace.But it will crumble quickly.I'll begin drafting right away.You want me to have Eammontake a look?Aye. You better.I know this is a lotof my own making.- But I need time to change it.- I know.And we don't need old enemiespicking off old friends.This could be worse.This could be the startof something new.- I'm walking with the ghosts.- Sir?Every week, I come hereto face the onesI failed to save.Not your fault, sir.It reminds meof what's really important.Not the battles,not the politics.The people.You see, I count corpses,not causes.All I wantis a brightnew day in my city.We're living in the shadowsof the past.I know. Come on, sir,we're not going back there.And, sir, listen.It wouldn't surprise meif the IRA deal with usbefore we get a chance to.That's what I'm afraid of.Another war.Get in, will you?Well, as you can see,I stopped walking my sonto school.It's a dangerous worldout there.I saw him once.He was coming out the courtout of the amnesty.I was on the beat,holding backthe victim's relatives.Never seen such contemptread large in someone's face.So someoneis definitely hunting downex-IRA men.Aye. Unh!Someone with a grievance.And a sense of irony.You sound as if you thinksomething like thiscould be justified.Vigilantes can neverbe justified.You're a man of old principle.Just a man of principle.Not too many of them around,that's all.So it's been a while sinceyou've come looking for me.Must be needing something done.Aye. You've heard aboutthe killings?Who hasn't?Except those that don't matter.What do you reckon?Could be nothing,could be a paramilitary shade.One death in this cityis either unnoticedor the startof some shit storm.Anyway, you didn't come herefor my political assessment.- What do you want?- I want you to look around.Check out the usual agents.Warn them offor just tell youse all about it?Just call in, Eammon.We're in a different businessthese days.The end of the alley fromhereabouts, one of these houses.They never would've venturedfurther that way.They knew someone in here.Now, how could yoube knowing that?It's just to see themall the way along the street.Remember the makeshiftbarricades were just down there.It took the army two yearsto work up the nerveto move them.Mm. That side, nothing.Three yards this way?Eammon and his friendsare pelting youwith Molotov cocktails.Shall we go house to house then,question the residents?Well, enjoy. You'll get there.At least I knowwhat's already here.Oh, they look after their own.Or try.They knew his escape route.What does that tell you?What does that tell me?It tells methat someone's cleaning house.And are bloody good at it.But they'll make a mistake.Angry people always do.Anything I can do for you, sir?I thought we might havea quick word.Better handle them formally.Oh, and I appreciate youcalling my officeabout the unpleasantness.It's always good to hear aboutthese things early in the day.Of course, sir.We mustn't let thingsget out of hand.We're sculpting hope from ashes.It's a delicate processthat can bear no interruption.I've chosen the best manfor the job.He'll see it through.Discretion?Personified.You must explain to the worldthat Northern Ireland will notdescend into violence again.You won us this peaceand we'll maintain it.These are your people.They're hunting you, Colum.They're gonna kill you.Colleen, love,we've discussed this.Those people who diedhave retired.They had no protection.I've kept this in case thissort of thing ever happened.And I've contacts keepingan eye out for us.They won't get me.Colleen?I'm going in to workwith Kelly, love.When I'm gone,call the police.Tell them you thought you heardsomeone tampering with the car.And then take Marianand get a taxi to your sisters.Kelly? Yeah, it's me.I need a spin.Right now, yeah?They think they're so smart,these boys.Reckon that I would drive my carwithout checking it proper?It's not that easy.You know, if it were me againstsome sophisticated target,I would've gone for a roadside.If it was me,I'll never go near a car again.Then you never thinkit will be you.I can't have it.The press are going wild.I want this bloody messcleared up.And I want an assurancewe are not going back there.Not on my watch.Sir, it's difficult to discerna clear pattern.Especially without layingthe blame on loyalistsbecause all the victimswere ex-IRA.That isn't good enough.I want these people caught.Now I think you have a theory,James.You tell me.We're talking internmentconditions, remember them?I will take anyoneoff the street,evidence to follow later.That is not gonna workand you know it.Just find my man.- Give me my peace back.- Ugh.I've spent half my lifecleaning up bloody messes.Some coming in for causes,some for revenge, some for fun.I know these people.I will find them.All right, all right.What have you got?Well, the only patternwe can seeis the victims are all IRA.That would indicateloyalist vengeance,but they're noteven celebrating.So that leaves uswith a highly motivated,previously unknown force?Uh, I still thinkthis is a private vendetta.I just can't figure outwhy they are targetingthe whole IRA.Most peoplehave a specific grudge.Well, if a specific grievancecannot be foundthen are we gonna assumeit's political?I could be wrong.Maybe somebodyis trying to restart the war.- What then?- God help us.Where's your party?Eammon.Been a while.What brings you backto the E Street?I'm thinking someonemight be crossing the water.Can you see any young onesmaking a move?No. I still keep on watch.Maybe a few yearssince everyone went quietbut I stand vigilant.I didn't see anything.Anything?No. They've been stayingtheir side of tracks.Haven't been over in forcein a while.I would have raised the alarm.Not a soul? Are you sure?No. We keep watch.Night and day as we do.Carry on.Aren't those nice jacket, Mitt?Aye, too nicefor an old shite like yourself.Ah, bloody peace.This city used to be too hardfor the likes of them.It won't start again, sir.Hmm, no chance.You think not.I will see.No. If it's possible.I don't know.I'll, uh...I'll talk to you later.Hi, Sinead.You're still the only womanwho could hold my eye.Sure, now, Owen.You've always knownwhat you want.And I was a close second.Aah.I have to thinkof all the fun we had.Oh, you've moved on,and up I see.But you're not goingto the politics game yourself.Uh, the door is always open.I have too much baggage.And my life is better for it.Why virus?Why is it always our lot?Revenge leads to revenge.No one is ever happyuntil they are grieving at you.We need something new.Not just the sametired old thing.Please, God...Not always the sametired old pattern.For years, I chasedevery agent with a bomb.Orange or green?Another force of the earth...Sending me to deal with this.A last whimper of The Troubles.None of our arising starswanna be associated with that.There's no change in the worldwhen what you wantis what you can't have.But a piece would be nice.No, that's not important.I can't see beyondthe IRA connection.So you bring inthe usual other suspects?Nah.They were never capableof something like thiseven at their height.We need reinforcements too.You'll protect the IRA boyswho might become targets.Oh, and that...Look into those wiretapsI was talking to you about, hmm?Aah.I have to rush backto the office, sir.Somebody messed upan applicationfor some case files.I'm so sorry, sir.I should be back,won't take long.How long have you got?I said it was paperwork,so not too long.How is our old friend?I'm keeping a close eye on himas you said to.Drop him off at night,linger there just make surehe doesn't go anywhere else.He's with me from morning on.And you're keeping a listof everyone he talks to?Every file he looks into?Every piece of paper he signs?Aye, sir.He doesn't seem much interestedin paperwork, sir.- I do most of it anyway.- Good.You understand, um,this may all haveto go away very quickly?Aye.It will be easy done.Stick terribly close to him.I'm afraid he may findthose responsibleand then be soovercome with morality,he won't hand themover to their, um, fate.You'll have to step invery quicklyif he shows any signof going native.Why did you choose him, sir?All of my connections aregenerally with the other side.He knowsthe loyalist militias.He's around when their informerswere managed.He's in the same communitiesas these avengers.Not many left in the force,that that can be said of.And my sympathieslie entirely with the new order.No sense in mixing worlds.It, um, complicates things.Aye. What about himself?Don't put himthrough that again.He'll be back in a minute.Your manis a million miles away.Murders, past or present,what do you reckon?Makes no difference to James.He knowswhat all those lads did.Or he thinks he does.Don't knock the man.He has a heart of gold.Ah, he certainly has, butwhat does he got to show for it?You didn't know himwhen he was young and fierce.I remember one time,the whole street explodedand he still managed to clipthe heels of the guilty lad.Aye, and inconclusive evidence.They got their man off,and he still got house bondfor his troubles.The world is strange...And to other news,three elderly men fromdifferent Belfast addresseshave all been reported missing.All three had been triedfor offenses during The Troublesbut not convicted.Among them is a prominentRepublican spokesman...Ah, that's me away, lads.I wonder whether he getshis man this time.- Well, here's to "this time."- Here's to "this time."It's a long way to comelooking for missing Belfast.Aye, well...We're looking for his spokesman.This is where he didhis speaking.Huh, shit.Imagine being lectured on yourmoral failings by a terrorist.I'm sorry, Kevin.Some people just don't knowwhen the war is over.They will when I get holdof them, yes, they will.I'm haunted, Owen.The past is too strong for me.We need to come clean.Be rid of it.Past is the past. Let it sleep.It's not sleeping,it's consuming me.Calm yourself.You're safe with me.You can't defend meagainst my conscience.You have a dutyto your former comrades as well.They're here.I think they're all dead.Shit.Of course they're here.Of course they're dead.Oh, these boysknow their history.We have their message.So this is wherethey made the old farm?Them and the Brits'shoot-to-kill policy.Aye.You have a point.Shoot to kill should neverhave been the policyof any civilized government.Three more bodies.It's an epidemic.If it wasn't for the remotenessof this godforsaken place,we have the press hereall over us.I know. I know.There's something I'm missing.- Unh.- But I will find them.You miss the point, James.You speak as if we're operatingin a vacuum.The fact that onlysome sort of miracleis preventing a general panichas obviously alluded you.That is not happeningbecause this time,everybody knowsthat those being killedhave blood in their hands.Are they less entitledto our protection then?No.But they maybe facing morethan we're ableto protect them from.Fancy supper, please.- Salt and vinegar?- Yeah.- Fish and chips.- Salt and vinegar?Cheers.- Fish and chips.- Salt and vinegar?I'll have all.Come on.Where? Where was it?Paddy. Paddy.Paddy? I'm sorry.Paddy.It's just supposed to bediamonds.God help me.I know you're so importantwith your son.But I'm gladyou met an early grave.I will never forgetthat little girl.You rememberwhen they let you out of jail?Thinking to myself...If there's any justicein the world......you will meet some fate.It's too glamorous. Too obvious.This is a decoy. Just a decoy.These boys are building a forestto hide a tree.Come on.About freaking time.Listen, Owen,the detective boysare on to something.Now I need to knowwhat it isif you still want meto find these lads.Pardon me?Sorry, love. Wrong number.Tell your boss I called.Prick.It brings out the flavor,which is essentialin a dish like this.One of the thingspeople often ask meis how they can obtain morevariety within the confines...Now, you see...What do you want?Some of your old friendsare being killed.And what's thatgot to do with me?I'm investigating the case.I'm here to offer youpolice protection.Oh, with your consent,of course.Why would I take protectionoff a lawless policemanlike yourself?Truth be told,your sympathies probably liewith these lads killing people.Go on celebrateyour last hurrah.I am here to enforcethe law of the land.Even if that meansprotecting scum like youfrom a fate you deserve.You take your moral high ground,years spent suppressing usto preserve your way of life.I went after anyonewho broke the law.Both sides, yours and mine.Let's talk aboutone of yours for a minute, eh?Murder expert.Big man, killed a lotof policemen in the barracks.One day,he needed some gelignite.So he sent three young boysto collect it for him.Gelignite is not too stable.Took half the buildingwith them.All that was leftto show one poor fatherwas a tongue.So we're both hard men.I can drink to that.It's easy to set a bomb.It takes a hard manto clean up afterwards.The lights are lit.Your monitor in the radiosays it will be over in 5.Aye, he's not worthmissing something over.All units, we have a shooting.It appears fatal.They're gonna kill me, Owen.They know.That's not gonna happen.It's not life I fear for,it's truth.Oh, it's tragic, isn't it?So senseless violence.That was a world ago.On a different time.And the innocents?Sometimes sacrificeshave to be made.There's not a day goes byI don't thinkof those who lost their livesin the cause or because of it.And it's their memoryand legacythat these modern day killersdirectly attack.Of course.And to survivesuch terrible things...It's no wonderyou're so desperateto lead us away from them.Aye.The irony is they only put upthose barriersafter his mortar attacks.They spent years tryingto put a stop to his violence.These boys comeand do it in a few seconds.At great cost though, sir.And also, if you can check...This is not a good time.Use the normal line.Youhaven't been answering yourself.Have you gotten your squeeze?It's tough at the top.I'll call you later.I have wanted to do thisfor years.I have been terrified thatsomeone would seek to harm me.Now I...I'm only scared that I might diebefore I would getto tell the truth.I have bombed and killed.And not a day goes by thatI do not pray for forgiveness.I'm not sure anymore that you'reeven trying to solve this thing.Pardon?An old shopkeeperhas been killed.And just becausehe was an IRA bomber,you don't care.Your politics are preventing youfrom keeping the peace.I lost everything I value.My politics and my opinionare the least of my sacrifices.Who...?My daughter.She was everything to me.I'm sorry. I didn't me...I'll go for a little stroll.I'll see you later.You're home early, dear.Aye. I needed a spot of lunchand some time to think.Is everything all right?I don't know.I always thought I knewbut maybe I never did.You're tired, love.You've been working too hard.Aye.I'll keep at it. Uh...Sorry. I'll eat out after all.You better get on.Another pensioner and suspectedIRA pipe bomber killed.Cause of death?Heart attack.Clever boys. Clever boys.Oh, yeah.They knew that he had builtso many of these in his day.Just the sound of a detonatorwould be enough to kill him.What sort of sick personwould kill a mandue to die in days anyway?I considered it myselfmany times.He took my daughterand 12 others.Rest in peace.How are you holding up, big man?I wanted to kill him.So help me, I wanted to.Yeah, but you didn't.No.A lot of good it did.He's dead anyway.- He's dead.- I heard.It's still notbringing her back.No.She's been at peace for too longto be troubled.Why send me?That was 20 years ago.I must look to the future,not alwaysto the tragedies of the past.You represent Sarah Aaronin my place.Who invited her?What are you doing here?I'm representing Sarah Aaron,trying to show respectfor your loss.Feck off, will you?Away with you!You work for a murderer, fine.But don't bring his flowersto our loved one's graves.Where the hell have you been?Around. Same as you.- Well?- Not a thing.Checking all the usuals.You've never let me down before.Why now?Too much easy living?You sound a little nervous,big man.Don't you worry.These are still nice streets.For old time's sake.I'll find these clever wee ladsand finish them.Fair winds, old friend.Hello, sir.How long do we know each other?Uh, a long time, sir.I can't believe we're here.Do you know how many casesthat piss our ass like this one?Aye, he always had a lawyerand a gun handy.It would be wanted herethis time. You mark my words.We have here a warrantto search Mr. Sullivan's homein relationto an ongoing investigationabout the deaths of severalprominent Republicans.The Northern Ireland PoliceService has noted publiclythat your client is notunder suspicion in any way,but rather we are actingpreemptivelyout of concern for his safety.My client welcomes your concernbut unfortunately,he's across the borderin business at the moment.- All right, just up there.- Aye.- Aye. Okay.- One over here.- All okay?- It's fine.What do you stand for?What's upsetting you?Seeing the pain you caused.I always believed you,your ideals.The rest was just the past.In war, things happen.Terrible things.I don't know what sad soultold you there was.But I stand before youwilling to make it right.How can you?When you won't acceptthe consequencesof your own actions?You're...You're the problem.That's true.I've seen some terrible things.But I am unique.I connect the evilest of thoseon our side with the means...I built the consensusthat brought us peace.And your continuing presencedestroys it.You don't understand.You're too young.You don't remember the causes.That's true.So I don't have to let them moldthe future.Yeah?Where?I got you, you bastards.The past is the past.Let it sleep.- We're at peace, Damien.- What kept you, sir?I had some businessto attend to.I thought I'd catch you fora quiet word at the same time.Anyway,I just heard from the Big Man.- Owen?- Yeah.He's concerned.He says that South Irelanddoesn't have the resourcesfor taking actionon this sort of thing anymore.He wants us to throw our weightbehind our Unionist detectives.And, by any means possible,put a stop to these killings.But that's justwhat we've been on.It's worse.He's admitting the UIRcan't handle these lads.They've met their matchin the rough stuff department.And are appealing to friendsthey made in the police force.He's made it clear he expectsthese friends to deliver.So, what's the problem?We keep doingwhat we've been doing, except...No. Not exactly.I didn't haul myselfout of the same gutterOwen did before I playedinto the hands of others.It's a new dawn.I should have smelledit earlier.So, what are we to do?The IRA had become old men.Cringing politiciansturned so legitimatethey can't defendtheir own lies.We mailed them.But they're in no positionto call in a favor.And, may never be again.We help James.Make it seemwe're pushing him through.When he findsthis new force of his,ha, ha, and he will,we let them finish the jobthat they started.They get their revengeand go home happy.And as we embrace a new Belfastwithout an IRA,we shall be leftwith those left standing.Sacrament most holy,sacrament divine,all praise and all thanksgivingbe every moment thine.Through him, with him, in him,in the unity of the Holy Spirit,all praise and honor are yours,Almighty Father.Forever and ever.Sorry, lads, we're a bit lost.Is there a petrol stationnear here?I knew you'd come.But what does it matter now?You've lost.You're the lastof the loyalist scum.And no one wants you.You flatter yourselves like youcame up like innocent victims.But you didn't.You camebecause you've lost your colony.And now it's time for youto go home.But homedoesn't want you either.You're the bastard sonsof a fallen empire.With so much bloodon your hands,you're just lookingfor someone to blame.Someone who resisted.I'm one.Do whatever you want to me,you fuckers.More will rise in my place,we'll drive them to the sea.You fucking Protestant loyalist.Murderers.Rapers of Irish sovereignty.I'm a Catholic Irishmanfrom Newry.I came about my family.My father wasa good Nationalist.He believedin the United Irish Republic.He was never a rich man.He ran a small petrol stationnear the border.Then one day,your folks came by to buy itat a knocked down price.They explained it was neededfor fund raisingas part of your IRAsmuggling empire.My father repliedthat it was his living.And he couldn't supportmy family without it.Your lads were a littlemore heavy-handed thenthan they are today.At the end of the month,his mutilated bodywas found in the riveron your farm.The propertysomehow got re-deeded.My mother was never the same.A month later,she died of grief.Leaving me and my brothersand sisters orphaned.And at the time, the IRAhad a heavy disciplinary hand,so no one would take us in.In the end,they put us all up for adoption.Separately.I was sent to Belfast.All my siblings went to England.I've been tryingto trace them ever since.But the documentationwas all lost,or obscured during The Troubles.I lost my whole family.Not surprisingly,I sat outthe rest of The Troubles.I wanted an Irelandfree for all men.Neither of yous wanted that.So I'm gonna give you a chanceto defend yourselfwith your favorite weapon.Of course,they won't hold me downthe way they did my father.And I'll have one as well.He's dead. Enough.You could still tell who he is.No one knew my father.Mm-hm, okay.James.So sorrynot to have caught you earlierand saved you a trip.Wonderful news.I managed to fast trackyour retirement payment.You'll be clear of all this rot.- Sir, about the case...- Don't worry about that at all.I've had Damien herepick up all your files.You won't have to think aboutany of these dreadful thingsanymore.You'll... You'll be at peace.But, sir, I found the killers.I know who they are.Leave it, James.You can do no more good here.Take care now, sir.You can keep the rest.Lucky aim, man.Aggravating, isn't it?Running from onefret into another.Reminds me of the night youand our heroic first ministerdropped car bombsall over the city.Don't worry,I'll get him myself.Clean sweep.Who the hell are you?The question is,who I should have been.I should have been freeto raise my wee boywithout your legacy of violenceand lies.I want him to grow upand not know your versionof right and wrong.Someone always hasto buy the last round.Ahead of thisevening's Saor Éire Nordash.Rioting has broken outin several areaswhere loyalist communitieshave bumped the police cordon.Soon Ireland's presidentand the first ministerof Northern Ireland,who will be deliveringthe main speech tonighthas called for...Let him through.He's harmless.Not so long ago,I believed...Owen, they're going to kill you.Don't go out there.For once, listen.Owen?Owen.This is my city.A world of my own making.Owen?We interruptthe scheduled broadcastto bring youvery important breaking news.We can now confirmthat while addressing tonight'sSaor Éire Nordash in Belfast,the first ministerof Northern Ireland,Owen McKenna, has been shot.Don't you wantto hear what happened, love?I already know.- Hi, inspector.- Hi.How's the retirement going?It's been two months already,isn't it?Yes, seems to have flown by.- Here you go, sir.- Thanks.All right. Take care.Is violence ever justified?You seen enoughto know that it's not.You've heard my story.And I'm gratefulfor your silence,which I'll take as sympathy.But maybethere's a better explanationof why we did what we did.My friend onceexplained to methat he'd had a wee boyand it changed his life.All he wanted wasa peaceful world for his son.He will pay any price for that.One day, a politician was beingdriven through their street.His wee son asked:Who's that, Dad?Somebody who usedto kill people.But he doesn't anymore.- Did he go to jail?- No.We wanted it all to end,so wee ones like youcould grow up safe.Eh?And his reply shocked himself.He told me afterwards,that at that moment,he realized he would rather livein a worldwhere every misfiring carwould send him divingto cover his sonfrom a bomb blast,than in a world of peacewhere his soncouldn't distinguishbetween right and wrong.I happen to agree with himfrom more bitterpersonal experience.So with an eye on the future,we decided to bury the past.Not in silence,but in justice.To let it sleep.So won't you?I'm going for a walk, dear.See a new day born.And on this historic day,as Ulster take their seats,we can all welcomein a new world,a united Ireland.Whole and at peace.A dream that...
