One bluefish fillet.Very nice.Seems like a fair trade.How's your dad's boat coming along?Mm. Slowly.Like father, like son, I guess.Well, your dad never rushed a project.He never seemed to finish one, either.Well, as John Foster Dulles once said,"A man's accomplishments in lifeare the cumulative effectof his attention to detail."Secretary of State Eisenhower.Smart man.Sure, Bob.Whatever you say.Jeff!Jeff!Judy.What can I do for you today?Well, is there any chanceyou can you take a look at my outboard?It turns over,but I-it just keeps quitting.Sure.So I called Ted over,and Ted helped me put this up here,but he couldn't get it running.Well, let's take a look.You know, if the engine's turning over,you're probably getting a spark.Uh-huh?- Maybe just not enough fuel.- Oh.Thank you so much, Jeff.It's really kind of you.Just what I thought,your fuel filter's clogged.Oh!Beautiful boat.Did you restore it yourself?No.Who did the work?It's, uh, it's impressive.Uh, some guy in Boston.Is that where you're sailing in from?Yeah, Charlestown Marina.Ah.Bradley! You made it.Uh-huh.- Great day for a sail.- Oh, definitely.- Good to see you.- You too, man.I told you this was beautiful.It is that.This must be your sister, Stacy.How'd you guess?Well... what do you guyswant to drink?We got it all.Come on in!I still think this is weird.You've known this guy, what?Three days?Oh, come on, Stacy.I'm just saying...Must be nice...sailing around on your rich daddy's dime.Wouldn't know.Well, that should get you going...Ah.You should probably change this filter.And I'd check the fuel tank.I think there's some dirt in there.Okay.Oh!Oh! Oh, Jeff!Are you okay?I'm fine.Oh, thank you!Oh, you should probablyget that checked out, huh?Yeah, yeah.You have a good one, Judy.Thank you!Again, sorry for the mess,we're doing some last-minute touch-ups,but I wanted you to geta first look at the new wing,funded entirely byHarriet's Hope Foundation.Dr. Madieras.Hi, Payton.Welcome.So, follow me, but please be careful.With the construction,I don't want anyone getting hurt.Jeff Jackson.Zee Madieras.This is certainly a surprise.So you're back from New York.Uh, a few years ago.What about you, what are youdoing on the island?Moved here about a month ago.My dad's old place."Doctor" Madieras.Yeah, imagine that.What about you?I heard you were a detectivewith the Boston PD?I was.Early retirement.Why's that?Missed fishing on the Vineyard.Oh, yeah?Is that how you hurt your back?Fishing on the Vineyard?No. Uh, it just goes outsometimes.Okay.My doctor back in Bostonwould give me a cortisone shotwhen it acted up like this.Since you're a new patient here,I can't give you a shotuntil I've taken an x-ray.Is that really necessary?Yes. Stand up.I'll take a look.Ooh.Recent surgery?Six months ago.And what'll I see on the x-ray here?Some pins holding your vertebrae together?No.A bullet.I'm guessing this is the real reasonfor your early retirement.They tried to dig it out,and then decidedit was too close to your spinal cord?You know your way around an x-ray.I also worked for seven monthsin New York Cityat the Coroner's office,so I've done enough autopsiesto know what a bullet can do to a body.You know, if this decidesto migrate closer to your spine,it could damage nerves.Possibly leave you disabled.So I've been told.What were you doing exactlythat aggravated it?Just being neighborly.You need to be careful with this.Yeah, I know.So how about that cortisone shot?Let's give it a few days,see how you're doing.Listen, I'll book you for a follow-up soon,to make sure that the inflammationdoesn't get any worse.You're the doctor.I am the doctor!So no more friendly repairs.Doctor's orders.Hi.

Thanks.Is Chief Madieras coming down?Oh, actually, there he is.Jeff.Probably not howyou wanted to start your day.No. I'd ratherbe pulling bluefinsout of the water right now.Want to tell us where you found him?Yeah, I found a jacket overdown on the rocks, by Bob's.Started to look around,and found him stuckup against those pilings.Any I.D. on him?No, sir.I'm pretty sure his name's Ray.He was staying on that Rhodes 77down near the end of the dock.You talked to him?A bit.I also saw him last night.Ah, here she is.She's my acting M.E.Zee is your acting M.E.?What are you, moonlighting?I'm the only doctor on the islandwho has autopsy experience.What about you?I thought you were retired.He found the body.Ah.Okay, let's see here.He looks familiar.Yeah, he was at the gala last night.Arguing with those two other kids.Oh, yeah, I saw that.That was Bradley and Stacy Martin.This guy was arguingwith Gerald Martin's kids?Yeah.Might want to talk to thembefore they lawyer up.You don't think it might'vebeen a simple drowning?Had too much to drink at the party,went for a walk?"Long walk off a short pier"?I don't think so, Chief.Oh, wait a minute.There's a lacerationon the back of his head.Maybe he smacked it against the dockon his way down?That way, it could be the blowand not the waterthat killed him.It's possible.He's wearing a ring.It's a graduation ring."Class of '85."He had boat keys in his pocket.I can show you the boat.All right, let's go.It's just over here.No obvious signs of foul play.And if he'd gone over the side here,the current would've taken himin the other direction.Came in alone, big boat like this?I didn't see anyone else with him,except when he took the Martin kids out.Anyone here?Martha's Vineyard Police!Open up!Hey, Chief.Take a look at this.Looks like a yearbook.I'll call a judge and get a search warrant,and I'll get Jenkins busylooking up the hull number.Sounds like you got it handled.Good luck.Hey, we're gonna need youto come down to the stationthis afternoonso we can getan official statement from you.All right.Hey! Jeff?Hi!What's going on?Everything okay over there?Listen, do me a favor, Judy.You see anyone else takingan interest in this boat,you give me a call.Sorry, just one second.Dr. Madieras, where's Mae?I'm acting M.E. this week.I don't suppose you could at least tell meif the victim drowned or...No comment for now.Come on, Zee.You gotta give me something."Vineyard...Haven...High."Let's see.What do we got here?"Vineyard Haven 25-yearhigh-school reunion...""Popular Vineyard Haventeacher retires...""Vineyard Haven alumdonate 50 new computers.""The donation was spearheadedby Gerald Martin,Vineyard Havenclass of '85."Hmm.Chief!Gerald.To what do I owe the pleasure?I wanted to have a chatwith Brad and Stacy, if they're home.No, I don't think so.They took the ferry to the mainland todayto see a concert in Boston.I don't expect them till tomorrow.Mm, kids these days, huh?Aw, you know.Yeah, come on in.Can I, uh, ask what this is about?A friend of theirswas found dead this morning.Dead?I'm real sorry to hear that.You know who it was?We haven't positively identified him yet,that's why I need to talk to your kids.We know they went sailingwith him yesterday,and they talked to himat the Harriet's Hope Gala last night.You're not suggestingmy kids had anything to dowith his death?I'm not suggesting anything.I just need to speak to them.How about I come by againtomorrow afternoon?Sure.I'll tell 'em to expect you.Great. Thanks, Gerald.Right...Yeah, sure.What is that?Gotcha.Okay, so you saw the body in the water,and then you called 9-1-1,and then what did you do?I waited.Look, have you looked upthe hull number of that boat yet?Uh, yeah, but it isn'tregistered to anyone named Ray.Well, who's it registered to?Um... I don't thinkI'm allowed to tell you that.I'm guessing this is the printoutof the registration.And now I can seethat the owner of the boat'sname is Donovan Fletcher.I've heard that name before.Excuse me.- Hey, Sara.- Oh, hey, Zee.- Is my Dad in his office?- Uh-huh.Dad, I found something you have to see.It's a small splinter of glassthat I found in the laceration woundon the victim's head.You know what this means?It sounds like he was murdered.So this Ray kid didn't drown?He was murdered.That's what your officialreport's gonna say?It's going to say that the cause of deathwas blunt-force trauma to the head,likely from something made of glass,or with a glass component.And you're sure he didn't fallonto or throughsomething made of glass?No, the angle of impactmakes that unlikely.Then whoever killed himmust have dumped his bodyin the ocean after the fact.So you got a graduation ring,and the Vineyard Havenyearbook on the boat...both from the class of 1985.I got curious...so I looked up the class of '85...and I found this online.And Gerald Martinwas in the Vineyard Haven class of 1985.And last night, when I was at the bar,Ray came up to introduce himselfto Gerald Martin,and the Martin kids were right there,doing their bestto literally drag him away.But wait...if they were trying to protecttheir father from Ray,why would they get on a sailboat with him?Sir? Uh...Detective... Jeff,he thought I should run priorson the sailboat owner Donovan Fletcher?Oh, he did?- What'd you find?- A lot of arrests.Mainly in Boston.Grand larceny, fraud, extortion,I've got his mug shot.He was there last night, too.Right next to me, at the bar.Run a search for his known associates.Yes, sir.So Ray's sailing around on a boatowned by this guy Fletcher.H-He's hunting down Gerald Martin,using his kids to get to him,and somehow he gets bashed in the head.You got your work cut out for you.Well, I'll let you get to it then.Jeff, wait. Um...This investigation looks likeit's gonna be a lot more complexthan usual.What do you mean, usual?We've had one homicideon the island in 12 years.Right.We're not exactly swimmingin experience here,and you've worked how many homicides?Too many.Yeah, we could really use your help.You could lend usyour expertise, maybe help steer the case?That's a really good idea.No, it's-it's not.I'm-I'm retired.Not by choice.You're still a detective.Otherwise, you never would'vebrought us this.Okay, yeah, you know, my mind goes there,but I can't work this case.I'm not a cop anymore.And besides...I'm done with all that.Oh, what, you don't care aboutcatching the bad guy anymore?Really?You don't even know what you're asking me.You think I don't knowwhat I'm asking, but I do.I know where you got that bulletyou're carrying around.You know, your Dad used to tell methat people rarely dowhat they're great at,what they love.They do what's easiest......And spent the restof their lives regretting it.Oh, I remember.You really gonna play the "Dad" card?There's a killerrunning around this island...Then hire a real detective.I can give you a few names.Thanks.You're right.I'm sorry I put you on the spot.This case is mine.Not yours.Uh, Chief?Gerald Martin is on hold for you.He wants to know if you wantto come back out to the houseand speak to his kids?Thanks, Jeff.Jackie Shawl?Your office told me I could find you here.Something about a board meeting?Yes, well, they barred me from sitting in.And you are...?Jeff Jackson.Doing some research for Chief Madieras.I wanted to ask youabout an article you wrote.What can you tell me about Gerald Martin?Well, it's interesting you ask.Why should I answer?Found a body this morning.At the pier.You're the one who found the body?And I recognized him as someonewho was trying pretty hardto talk to Gerald Martinat the gala last night.Gerald Martin.I see.Well, then we definitely should talk.But if you can just hold on one minute...Helena! I knowyou don't want to talk to me,but you and your husband cannotdodge my questions forever!Jackie,this is not a good timefor Helena right now.Her car was stolen at the gala last night.She's very upset.Isn't that the least of her problems?If you have questions,you're welcome to ask me.It seems to methat you'd be more angryabout the allegationsby the I.R.S.than anyone.Well, if I thought they were true,I would be, but I don't believe it.How could I?I'll tell you what...I will talk to Thomas,and have him back to you atthe end of the afternoon, okay?When you came by earlier, Chief,I had no ideathat Brad and Stacy hadditched their trip to Boston.It's true.We didn't tell him we changed our minds.So, why don't you tell me how you met Ray,if that's his name.That's...That's the name he told us...Did he give you a last name?No.Where'd you meet him?At the bar in the yacht clubon Tuesday.He came up to me,we started talking, he bought me a beer,and said I had to go see his boat,and so we went down there,saw the boat, it was pretty cool,then he said to come back next timewith my sister.Why do you think he wanted youto bring your sister?I don't know, she came upin the conversation,and I thought he was being polite,so I-I asked her.And I had nothing better to do,so I went, too,although if I'd knownit was gonna be so weird,- I wouldn't...- "Weird," how?He was just...kind of nervous,like smiling too much or something,but I guess it was fine at first.But then he starts talking about our dad,and he's asking all these nosy questions...Super-intrusive,and we were thinking,"This is not cool."And we bring up the gala,and he's, like,"I want to go meet your Dad."And we told him no,because now we're thinking,okay, this guy really is weird,and then he shows up there anyway.I thought I'd leda complete stalker to my dad,so we-we got him out of thereas fast as we could.So you got him to leave?Yeah, I...We got him out of there,and we sort of stood guardoutside for a little while,and he left, yeah.Did he tell youwhy he was so interestedin meeting your father?Any idea why this kidwas so determined to talk to you?Well, people always want something from me.They want me to give them a job,or invest in their company.Who knows?Hmm.Okay. Thanks.My friend at the Globe knows you,she says you're one of the good ones.So I tell you my story,and you tell me about the body you found?That's the deal.A month ago, I got an anonymoustip about Harriet's Hope.This person had beenworking there a long time,and said that she believedsomeone was skimming moneyfrom the foundation.A lotof money.She saidover a million dollars had gone missingin the time that she was working there.Whew!I know.So I began asking questionsand, of course, got nothing but denial,so... and you can'ttell anyone this...I took it to the I.R.S.,and they actually started looking into it.Did they find proof?Well, the I.R.S. can't commenton an ongoing investigation.But it seems to me that to be ableto skim money over the long term,you have to have access to their books.And guess who owns the accounting firmthat keeps their books?Gerald Martin.Paper?Well, best of luck finding outwho that kid was.I have one more question for you.Sure. Go ahead.You ever hear of a guyby the name of Donovan Fletcher?No. No.Can't say that I have.Well, thanks for your time, Gerald.Sure.A three.Well, you're looking very doctor-y.Thank you.Uh, can you give me a sec?Yeah.'Kay.- Hey.- Hey.Um...I owe you an apologyfor pushing you so hard.No, you don't.Don't ever apologizefor doing everything you canto catch the bad guy.So you do still care.Of course I do.I mean, it was my whole life.- For a long time.- I know.I'm sorry.It's just that you've beenthrough a lot, and...Zee, stop.I'm not a wounded bird.And this isn't gonna workif you're gonna treat me like one.What's not gonna work?I'm in.I'm gonna helpyou and your dad work the case.Tch. Oh.Where do we start?First thing tomorrow,we start where the victimwas last seen alive.The yacht club.Okay. I'll see you there.Kelly!I got you, buddy.So Jenkins found a legitimatecompany owned by Fletcher,employing one Ray Norris...Oh, so we finally have a last name.Any idea what Ray did for him?No, but maybe we'll findan answer on that boat.Judge signed a search warrant this morning.Mm. So our working theoryis that Fletcher hadsomething on Gerald Martin.And you're thinking thatFletcher was blackmailing him?Well, he's been arrestedfor extortion before.I mean, it would explainwhy Martin might skim moneyfrom Harriet's Hope,if that's what he was doing.Yeah, let's sayhe was using the foundationas his personal ATM.He would've stoppedthe minute the I.R.S. showed up.And if he missed some payment to Fletcher,someone like Raywould show up to lean on him.But Martin fights back,kills Ray, dumps him in the ocean.So we might actuallyhave the "why."If we can figure outwhat Fletcher had on him.Although I'm thinkingit might have somethingto do with the class of '85.You know, I'd really like to take a lookat the yearbook we saw on that boat.I'll bring it back with me.Now, uh...the search warrant for the security footageat the yacht club.- We're on it.- Good.There. 920.That's when Bradleypushed Ray out the door.Wait. He's going back in.Let's see when he comes back out.There's Stacy.Wait.- Who's that?- Helena Percy.Is she crying?Well, Payton Bartel did saythat her car was stolen that night.Wait.She just went out of frame.She's back...seven minutes later.Maybe she went to look for her car?Yeah...A lot of people came outthe front door that night,but there's no Ray.I don't think Raycomes out this door at all.Bradley and Stacy lied.Yep.Looks like someone disconnectedthe camera for construction.If Ray didn't go out the front,he had to have come out the back.And so could any number of other people.We saw Bradley heading back here.You see what I see?Those glass blocks.Maybe...The head woundand that splinter of glass...One of these glass blockscould be the murder weapon.That means...That means this could be our crime scene.- I'll call my dad.- Yeah.That one's missing a tarp.Dad, you need to send a Forensics teambehind the yacht club.Okay, my dad's got a team on the way.What is it?Whoa, whoa, whoa.Drag marks.Through here.There's no blood trail.And don't scalp lacerationslike the one you found on Raybleed a lot?- Copiously.- Well, that couldexplain the missing tarp.You know, his killercould've wrapped him in itand dragged him......to the parking lot,to a vehicle.Right, 'cause he's got to getto the ocean somehow.You grew up here.If you had a body in your carand you needed to dump it fast...?Seems like a pretty publicplace to dump a body.No, it's really desolate at nightand this is the easiest placeto get a body into deep water.The yacht club's, like, half a mile away,so this is the first place I thought of.Looks like someone's drivenup here recently.We might be able to pick up these tracks.You know, the way the current flows,it could carry a bodyto where you found Ray.We need to get a teamdown here for a search,see if anything's washed up on this beach.- Hello?- Jeff?Oh, hi. It's Judy.Remember, you asked meto call you if anybodygot on that sailboat inthe slip across from mine...Well, if you're talkingabout the police searching it,they have a warrant.No, no, no, they came and went a while ago.No, I'm talking abouta guy on the deck right now.I've never seen him before.He's very suspicious.Be right there.We gotta go.There's nobody here.Where's Judy?Judy!- Judy!- Hey, Dad.Yeah.We're on the boat right now.No, if someone was here,they aren't here anymore.Judy?Jeff!Did you see him?See who?I don't know. Yeah.Zee! Call the police!Jeff!You hurt?I'm okay.Oh! Behind you!I don't think so.Oh! He's getting away!As far as I know,it's not against the lawfor a man to take possessionof his own boat.There was no sign sayingit was impounded or off-limits.Your bodyguard triesto toss my daughter overboard,and you swung a boat hook at him.Assault with a deadly weaponcan get you put away for a good long while.My client sawwhat he believed to beintruders on his propertywhile searching for spare keys.He and his security personnelacted within their legal rightto remove said intruders."Security personnel."Let's talk about other personnel.Ray Norris worked for you.Not as of a week ago.I fired him.You typically dismiss employeeswith a glass block over the head?I don't know what you mean.He was an unreliable deckhand,neglected to obey ordersin a timely manner.So I told him to get lost.Which he did.In my boat.You expect us to believehe stole your boat?It's not what I expected, I assure you.Why didn't you report it stolen?I have a reputation, and I prefer...You prefer to dish outretribution yourself?I prefernot to involvethe police in private matters.And I'm guessing you consideryour business with Gerald Martin"a private matter"?Who's Gerald Martin?Yes!Still no sign of Fletcher's bodyguard?No. Fletcher keeps telling ushe can't reach him,but we'll round him up soonif he's still on the island.And I'll hold Fletcheron that assault charge for now.You believe what he said?Ray Norris stole his boat?Well, if it's true,it just made this case a whole lot simpler.The kid makes off with the boat,Fletcher chases him down,and then lives up to his reputationby killing him.Okay, if Ray did steal his boat,he'd know that Fletcherwould come after him hard.Yeah.What's the first rule of larceny?"Don't get caughtwith the merchandise."So you're saying what,Ray got himself a room while he was here?Well, it'd be stupid to stayon that boat, wouldn't it?I come bearing evidence.Oh, yeah?I found this in Ray Norris's pocket.The water was trying to turn it to pulp,but I was able to salvagesome of the larger piecesand put it together."2-1-1-5-9-3."It's not a complete number,but it's better than nothing.And I've been tryingto figure out what it is.I thought it was a phone number,but there'sno "211" U.S. area code.Maybe it's an international number?You might want to trya bank routing number.I've been doing my dad's probate stuff,filling out a lot of financial documents.The routing number for his bankstarts with "21137".Maybe there's another bankwith a similar routing number?Help yourself there.Okay, let's see here.No...Bingo.So Ray was walking aroundwith a bank account number in his pocket?Maybe it's Fletcher's?Or Gerald Martin's.Ray had his high school class yearbook.Where is that, by the way?It's right here.Sir? I just spoketo a hotel managerwho said that Ray Norrischecked in five days ago.What hotel?The Pendray.Anyone talk to him during his stay?Um, I haven't had the chanceto ask around yet.And what about housekeeping?Have they serviced the roomat all this week?Well, no, because... this.Ah.Well, Ray definitelywasn't sleeping on that boat.Ugh. Or eating anything closeto a healthy diet.Remind me never to let youlook in my fridge, Doctor.Should I go talk to my staff,see if anyone rememberstalking to this guy?Good idea.Jeff...Look at this.Helena Percy?What?I really couldn't tell youhow that young mangot a hold of my business card.You're saying you didn't getany calls from him?Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.You do knowthat his cell phone recordswill show if he called you.Well, I could check my voicemailand see if he left any messages.That'd be great, Helena.Only now is not the best time.Oh.What's going on, Helena?It seems the young man thatwe read about in the newspaper,you know, the one that waskilled the night of our gala...Ray Norris was killed atyour gala,behind the venue.Well, it seemsthat he had my business card.Well, my wife's business cardsare all over the island.She's in charge of fund development.We want donors to be able to find her.I was just about to check my voicemailto see if he'd contacted me.Payton checks your messages every day,you'd have known if he'd called.Helena's only in the office twice a week.Ah, well, there you go.Is there anything elsethat I can help you with?Yes, actually.Can you explain why you were cryingoutside the doors of the yacht club,less than five minutes afteryou were smiling up onstage?I thought it was because of your car,but you didn't report it stolenuntil after midnight.Well, it's because of all of that.Dealing with the I.R.S.We'd just been onstagebragging about our success,and in the meantime,we're dealing with them.Questions, suspicions...having to defend our integrity.Can you blame herfor being a little emotional?It's contemptible to be accusedof something with no proof.Helena?They're asking about the donationsearmarked for the new hospital wing.Okay.If you'll excuse us.- We have to resolve this matter.- Sure.She's lying.How can you be sure?Well, Ray's cell phone records will tell usone way or the other.That's my dad.He wants us meet him at the South Pier.Let's go.All right, boys.Pull it out.A tarp was missingfrom one of the glass block palletsbehind the yacht club,and Jeff thoughtthat it might have been usedto wrap around Ray, to transport the body.Your murder weapon.So... I hear you've beenhanging at the police station,donating your detective skillsto the Chief.You hear about everything, don't you, Bob?I must have one of those faces.People just love to tell me things.Yeah, well, my, uh, "skills"haven't been able to crack the case yet,and I was hoping I'd findsome answers in here,but it's a lot of wishingsomeone named "Donna"a good summer.Ah, I knew a Donna in high school.No, wait.Someone named "Goose" saidhe loved dancing with her at prom.Hey, Chief.Whatcha got?Just reading the report from Forensics.They got traces of blood onthat glass block from the tarp.So no doubt it's the murder weapon?Yeah, but no prints.That's too bad.You know,if it was freshwater instead of saltwater,we might've had a shot.Yeah, they did manage to lifta couple of partialsoff one of those other blocksthat fell off the pallet.I'm guessing they're gonna be Fletcher's,or maybe that so-called"security personnel" of his.I'm not so sure that's your best bet.The simplest storyis always the best bet.Oh, and listen, uh,the lab also sent us the model of tiresthat made those tracks down at the pier.If they match the tires on Fletcher's car,then I think we have our guy.Would you mind texting me the model?There's another angleI want to work on that.- You got it.- Thanks.Bob?If I was gonna unload a stolen car,where would I go?I do know a guy.You Gus?You got a sec?22,075,000, accordingto the average life span.I guess I could spare a few.Great!Well, it looks like Vineyardsalvaging is really paying off.Yeah, metalis worth its weight in gold these days.It's a good little side business.I'm, uh, looking for some partsfor my mother-in-law's car.She's got high-end tasteswith a low-end budget.You know what I mean.What kind of parts are you looking for?Something that would fit a BMW 7-series.You got anything like that?Now, there's a coincidence.I had one of those come in yesterday.It's not a coincidence?Nope.You want to tell me where you got it?I got a lot to do today.Oh, that's fine.I get it.I can just call my cop buddyand have him come down here with a warrant.Well, now, now, you don't need to do that.Okay, then.You tell me where you got it,and we can forget we everhad this conversation.Deal?Deal.Yeah.After you.Local guy brought it in.He found it out in the state forest,thought it was abandoned.You know... fair salvage.It wasn't hotwired.Why are you following me?You still holding a grudge about that swim?No. I just wantedto ask you some questions,and didn't want the cops involved.Too late.Good thing you got a beadon him when you did.I've been shadowed by better.He was trying to stop you finding evidencethat pointed to him and his bossfrom Helena Percy's stolen car.Yeah, well, there's something elsebothering me about that car right now.It wasn't hotwired.Whoever stole it had a key.Aw, man.Sounds like a party.Oh, excuse me.Zee, hi.Hi, Payton.What's the occasion?The I.R.S. just informed usthey finished their investigation,and found no wrongdoing with our books,which I always said they would.Well, that's great.And we're about to makeHelena's day even better.Jeff found her car.Oh, my goodness.I... I'll go get her.Helena, Jeff and Zee...We are very happy to hearabout the car, of course.It was a minor headachecompared to what we weredealing with here, though.Well, you can pick it up tomorrow.But, unfortunately, we don'thave any keys to give you.We assume you have a spare set?Ah, more than one.She's always misplacing her keys,so I made several sets for her...one for her desk, one for her purse,one for home,just in case.So any number of people couldhave had access to those keys.Technically, yes.See you two on the boat!All right, Goose.See you out there.Cheers.Did you just call him "Goose"?Nickname from high school.Everyone thinks it's from Top Gun,but it was from before that,wasn't it, Tom, because of his laugh?Right, our Goose is the original.They should pay him a licensing fee.Funny.Well, we'll let you get back to your party.Let's go, Zee.Um, thank you.Thanks.Cheers.Jenkins?Did you find it?Pulled it upand printed it out right after you called.Birth certificatefor "Raymond Joseph Norris."Donna Marie Norris,Mother.Father...Hmm. Unknown.Okay, so if Gerald Martinwas the "Goose" who took Donna to prom...Ray wanted to meet Gerald Martinbecause he believed Martin was his father.Yeah.Jeff!I got some news for you.We got a match on the printswe got off the glass blockfrom the yacht club.It's not Donovan Fletcher.Gerald Martin?No, it's another Martin.Bradley?No. It's his sister. Stacy.Stacy Martin's printwas on one of the glass blocks?Why would her prints even be in the system?Little shoplifting incidenta few years ago.But now we've got herat the scene of the crime,handling a block identicalto the murder weapon.If we're right about Ray's mom,we have a motive.Yeah, I'm gonna need youto explain that one to me.I didn't put it together at first, either,but, in high school, the Donnawho owned this yearbookwas named Donna Lawson.And she has a note in herefrom someone named "Goose"...That's Gerald Martin's nickname.Here they are together.Back up a little bit.Ray Norris was born in, what, '96?March 1996, in Concord, New Hampshire.I know that Martin marriedBradley and Stacey's momlong before '96.T-The math just doesn't add up.Well, when I looked up the class of '85,I saw an article about a class reunion.This class's 10-year reunionwould have been in '95.I'm thinking Martin and Donnareconnected at the reunion.She got pregnant, but he was married.And that's why she put "father unknown"on the birth certificate.But she still his class ringand, at some point,she gives it to Ray, tells him the truth.So he came here to meet his father,except his other kidsdid not like that at all.Right.Well...let's go talk to them.Chief. What can I do for you?We need to speak with Stacy.Bradley, too.Well, they're not here.I'm not sure where they went.Well, you either need to round them upand bring them down to the stationwith your attorney,or I'll have to put out an APB on them.This is aboutour murder victim, Ray Norris,the one I saw youshaking hands with at the gala?Okay. And?Well, Ray Norris is the sonof Donna Norris.Formerly Donna Lawson.Name ring a bell..."Goose"?I went to prom with Donna.And that was her son?We were wonderingif it might also have been your son.You're serious?Look, I don't think that's possible.I mean, the last time I saw Donnawas in '89, '90, '91.You don't seem too sure.Just find your kids,call your lawyer,and meet us at the station, all right?Zee? What's up?Um, I came to The Dukefor an early lunch,and guess who's here?Bradley and Stacy Martin.Hey.Hey, I'm so sorry.Stacy leftand I just didn't feellike I could tackle heron her way out the door.- Where is he at?- Over there.Well, let's see what old Brad has to say.Not good.Bradley, wait.We want to help you.Look, if you think I'm gonnatell you where Stacy is,you can forget it.Hey. You want to protect her.I respect that.Whatever, man.Look, I think you should know what we know,at least thenyou can make an informeddecision about what to do.Okay.What do you know?Why don't you sit down?We know Ray believedhe was your father's son.He thought you were his brother,and Stacy his sister.That's why he took you on that boat ride.It was so ridiculous.He brought us outinto the middle of the ocean,he starts telling usthis crazy story about how my dadgot together with his momat the high-school reunion.Did you believe him?Well, we didn't want to,but then he shows us this yearbook,and a ringhe says that my dad gave his mom and...He had a...He had a bank account number.Okay? He called thishis "real proof."He said, that most of his life,his mom got monthly paymentsfrom our father.When his mother died,he found that account number.And he wanted more money from your dad?I shouldn't be telling you this...Ray went to the gala to confront your Dad.You and Stacy tried to stop him,but you couldn't get him to leave.No. Yes, we did.We did make him leave.Bradley, there are securitycameras outside the yacht club.We know he went out with you,but then he went back in.And we know Stacy followed him back in,and went out the back door.We know this because we found her printson one of the glass blocks behind the club.That is because he pushed her into them.So you found them together behind the club?Did you feel like you had to protect her?I have to go.Was he about to confess?What do we do?We follow him.Come on.Thanks.Those are boat keys.They must have a boat in that garage.Stay here.It's gonna be fine.Brad, no, don't run!Bradley!He didn't do anything!Hey!That's not the way out of this, kid.First of all,running down my clients like that?Not the way to win their cooperation.This is all ridiculous anyways.Ray Norris is not my son.I mean, he told my kids that I supposedlygot together with his motherat our 10-year reunion?Well, I didn't even goto my high-school reunion.I was working in London.You can check with my boss.It's not true.Doesn't matter if it's true or not.Of course it matters!I think it kind of matters.No, what mattersis that these two thought it was true.You believed him, didn't you?You believedhe was gonna force his wayinto your family.You believed he was gonnademand your father's time,his money...Things you two were usedto getting all to yourselves.- It's not true.- Dut-dut.Do not answer that.Not that it matters.Motive without evidenceis useless in a court of law.We have Stacy's prints on a glass block.Not the actual murder weapon.But that puts her at the scenethe time the murder took place.And then what?At 9:53, Bradley Martinwas seen on security footagefrom the yacht club,entering the front door,and then eyewitness saidthat he thenwent straight to the coat room.Where Helena Percystated she left her coat,with the car keys in the pocket.How would I know that?I went in there for...Shh, shh, shh!Wait, wait, wait, wait.First, you say Stacy's printsprove she was there,then Brad going into a coat closet means...A jury would probably think it meanshe helped her get rid of the body.Maybe even more than that.Or maybehe was just defending his sisterduring an altercation with Ray.Is that possible?If that's the truth of it,then you could claim self-defense.But if you want that to fly,you've got to tell us what happened.Speculation is not evidence.You don't have enoughto arrest these two,let alone convict them.I think we're done here.Let's go.We didn't kill him.He was alive the last time we saw him.Okay, Stacy. Let's go.My dad saidyour interview with Brad and Stacydidn't go so great.Lawyers are always good at minimizing,but...she wasn't wrong.I mean, we still gota lot of dots to connect.I was thinking maybe these kidswrapped something else in that tarp.You know, something that could'vewashed up somewhere here on this stretch.Yeah, maybe they slippedtheir I.D.s in there.Or, like, a phonewith the crime recorded on it.I was thinking a note that said,"We did it."Yeah.Of course, it would have to bein tiny little pieces,so you could have funputting it back together.I don't want to laugh,it might give you the idea thatI like your sense of humor.Oh, I wouldn't dare think that.Not after what you said to me that nightafter Wazzy's party out there on the pier.You told me I was"sophomoric."I had to go homeand look up what that meant.I mean, of all the things to remember,you had to remember that.I can remember other things, too.Yeah, it was a fun night.Yeah, it was.Jackie?Yeah.I can do that. Yeah.I'll see you then.Jackie Shawl?She wants to meet in the morning.Okay.Well, I've got go check in on a patient,so good luckwith your needle-in-a-haystack operation.I'm not saying the I.R.S.didn't do their due diligence,but I was certain that the tip I gotabout money-skimmingand Harriet's Hope was legit.How so?I think Gerald Martin, or someone,cooked their booksand covered their tracks.Or your source was wrong.Could be, but I believed it for a reason.I think the tip came from Payton Bartel.The executive director?What makes you think it was her?The attention to detail.I think she tried to getto the bottom of it herself,and when she couldn't,she did a little whistleblowing.On her own organization?Well, her father started it,and she had to hand it over to the Percys.And the Percys are the oneswho got the big donations...the office,the boat they take other donors out on.And Thomas handedthe financial reins overto his buddy, Gerald Martin.Still.It seems like Payton would beshooting herself in the footto bring attention to the problem.Not if she got her foundation back.Yeah...I know the Percys seem nice,but I also think that you knowbetter than anybodythat people are not always what they seem.Did O'Connor finishgoing through Ray's cell phone records?Did he make any calls to Helena Percy?No?We found her business cardin his hotel room.You know, maybe he called from his room.Could you check on that and get back to me?Yes, uh..."Local doctor Zee Madieras,daughter of Martha's VineyardChief of Police,enjoys an afternoonat the luxurious Pendray Inn."Mm-hmm!Why would you post that?Okay, if word gets outthat a murder investigationcame through here,I wanted folks checking us outto see that important peoplestill flock here.Come on!First of all, this is weeks old,and, secondly, nobody says I'm important.And third...you should have asked.Okay, you're right.You're right, I-I should have.But...if the numberof social media "likes" count,you are important.No!Okay, look.Look how many "likes" onthis picture of us at the gala.Well, yeah, we look fabulous.Mm-hmm. Ooh...Did you see this one?You and the handsome detective.Wait a second...That looks like Ray Norris.Yeah, it is.That's... That's our victim.Yeah, I remember seeing him at the gala.He was talking to Helena Percy.Right after she came off the stage.What?What...I'm so sorry, I have to go.So, look, this is...right after the speeches,and there's Ray.- And Britt posted this?- Mm-hmm.What's that hashtag she's using?Um, "Harriet's Hope Gala."Well, see if there's any otherphotos using that same hashtag.Yes!Bingo.Look who Ray's walking towards,when he comes back in...that's Thomas Percy.And Britt told me she saw himtalking to Helena.Keep going.Wait. Right... Right there.Yeah.Play that video....Be merry.And dance!Yes, please dance.As long as you don't havetwo left feet like me.You know, someone once said to me..."To loveand be lovedis everything."So thank you, everyone,for showing us your loveand allowing us to spread itfar and wide...- Where are you going?- Come on.You know how, in yearbooks,they had everyone pick a quoteand print it under their photo?Look at Donna Lawson's."To love and be loved is everything."Thomas Percy used Donna'sfavorite quote in his speech.That's what turned Ray around.H-He was probably thinkingthe same thing I'm thinking right now...that Thomas, not Gerald, was his father.So he's the one who reconnected with Donnaat the 10-year reunionfor some one-night fling?Well, he was quoting her about love.He was sending money,even after the kid was grown...I'd say it was more than one night,which makes it even more difficult to hide.You mean from Helena.He called her.Ray, that is,three hours beforehe showed up at the gala,from his hotel room.She said he didn't,but the Pendray has a PBX phone systemthat tracks calls.Helena lied.And Ray was talking to her.Right before he got killed.Come on.Where is everybody?Hello?Oh!You scared me.You're back.We're here to talk to Helena Percy.Or Thomas,if either of them are available.No, I'm sorry,they gave the staff the day off.I'm just here puttingsome files back in storage.Is there something I can help you with?Actually, there is.Um, my dad hasn't made any arrestsin the murder of Ray Norris...Oh, I thought your dadhad someone in custody.Someone named Fletcher?Well, we haven't ruled him out,but we've come acrosssome photos of the victimattempting to talk to Thomasthe night of the gala.Talk to Thomas?Why would he do that?That's a good question.You have any guesses?He also called Helena just before the gala.Did she happen to mention that to you?Uh...No.No, I don't think so.Well, Percy told usthat you pick upHelena's messages sometimes.Did you pick up her messagesthe day of the gala?Yeah, I may have.There was someone who called,wanting to know if he neededa ticket to get into the gala.Was it Ray Norris?I really don't remember.And did you pass that message on to Helena?Or did you delete it?What?Payton...you know exactlywho Ray Norris is, don't you?I don't know what you mean.And you know that Thomaswas having an affairwith Ray's mother.And that he was supporting a child.You know what?I think I hear someone right now.Maybe it's them.I'll go check.Why are you talking to her like that?Because she's in it up to her neck.[Her office is down this way.Payton.Payton, wait!You just need to answer a few questions.- Whoa!- Stop right thereor I'll shoot her, I swear.- Payton...- You should've justlet me walk out.Payton, you don't need to do this!Zee, look at me.It's gonna be okay.She doesn't want to hurt you.Do you, Payton?- I never wanted to hurt anyone.- I know.You were just trying to protectthe foundationthat bears your mother's name.Get back.Get back to the conference room!And that's why you made a pactwith Thomas Percy, isn't it?He raised money for you,and you turned a blind eye while he...What? Set upa phony vendor numberso he could send money to Ray's mother?Get back!But you had it under control.You and Percy figured outa way to cover your tracks.It was all gonna blow over.Until Ray showed up at that gala.Ray Norris,who was there to demandhis father pony up more money.I'm sorry.This is a private party.Oh, really?My name's Ray Norris.That man, Tom Percy,is my biological father.Maybe he told you what he wanted.Maybe you convinced him you wanted to help.Thomas...Told him, if he stayed out back,you'd send Percy out to meet him.And that's when Stacy Martin found him.You are embarrassing your...They argued,and then her brother showed up...Stacy!...And triedto make Ray leave.Hey! Hey, no. Forget it!It's fine, let's go.This isn't over, Ray.And that's when you confronted him.Mr. Norris?I spoke to Mr. Percy.He has no clue what you're talking about.What if I told you I had proof?But we knowhe had an account number in his pocket.Zero-two-one-one-three-five-nine-eight-seven-zero.Does that account numberring any bells to you?It was a Harriet's Hopeaccount number, wasn't it?It was a numberthat would have destroyed everythingthat you and your familyworked so hard to build.What choice did you have......But to kill him?Stop!Jeff!Jeff!Jeff!Kelly!Zee!Get on board.Move it!Okay, just don't shoot.Sit down and don't move.Get up the stairs. Now!Zee!Take it easy!Payton!Payton...Ah!Jeff! Watch out!Drop it!You okay?Are you all right?Yeah.Any news on the board re-electing you?None yet.But if they do, it'll be thanks to you.Well, if you're passing around credit...You should probably pass someto your daughter.Oh! He always makes mefeel appreciated.You ready?Mm.Just so you know,this house call's a one-time deal.Cortisone is not the bestsolution to your problem.You have a better solutionyou want to offer?How about not trying to makea long jump record onto a boat?Even if it was pretty dazzling.You know, you're allowedto tell me you were impressed.Oh.You gonna tell mehow this bullet got there?Maybe.Someday.And, yes, you dohave to catch your own dinner.Uh, I'm from the Vineyard.I'll catch mine and I'll catch yours.- Oh!- Yeah!You're something else, you know that?Let's see what you got.How do you think it's going to go?How I'm going to do?I think you're gonna get skunked.You think you're gonna catch something?Are you kidding me?It's all in the wrist.- Look at these style points.- What style points?Side-arm, one-handed...
