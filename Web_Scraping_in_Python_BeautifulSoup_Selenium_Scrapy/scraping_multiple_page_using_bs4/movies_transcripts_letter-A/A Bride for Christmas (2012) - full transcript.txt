We can't all crush her dreamsof those adorable grandkids.- Oh, god.- Come on.Let's get back in therebefore Marcie turns thisinto a bad '80s dance party.Look what I have!Too late.Mom?Remember when we talked aboutthe difference betweenloving someoneand being in love?Nope.Nope, not at all.Love is love.Mom.I'm sure you dated other guysbefore dad,and maybe you even lovedsome of them.How did you know dadwas the one?By marrying him.Let's go.OK.Jessie!Hey.Hey, what do you thinkabout doinga crushed velvet and chromefor aunt Kate's house?With maybe... A gray tile...But I really like the idea of...A nice gray couchwith some purple pillowsand maybe a chrome lamp, right?I mean, it's perfect for her.What happened?I don't know!I have no idea.I mean...I really thought I coulddo it this time, you know?And then... and then...I saw him, I saw Mikeat the altar, and I just...suddenly, I just felt...god, I just felt so...what?I care about him, you know?I mean, I really, reallycare about him.I just... I don't...Love him.Not like that.God, what is wrong with me?I mean, I've broken not one,not two, but three...three engagements.You came pretty closeto sealing the deal this time.How is he?After you left, he kind ofput his fist through the pulpit.Reverend Maceywas really nice about it.I should have never saidyes in the first place.Probably.Viv, he asked me to marry himin front of 50,000basketball fans.Did you want me to break hisheart on a 100-foot Jumbotron?Is it any worse than breakinghis heart at his own wedding?You're right.That's pretty awful.I'm awful.Jessie, that's not what I meant.No, you know what?It's fine.I'm clearly not meantfor the whole marriage thing,so this is it.I'm done hurting people.No more wedding planning.No more engagement parties.- I'm done.- Don't say that, OK?Yes, Trent, Owen, Mike...They're all really great guys.But if you weren't feeling it,then maybethey just weren't the one."The one?"Really, Viv?And when do I knowwhen I meet the one, huh?Is there gonna besome sort of fireworks boomingor sirens flashing?Is that how I'm gonna know?I think it just...Happens.Well, unless there'ssome sort of guarantee,I'm done.Call.Two pair.- Straight.- I can't believe it.Pocket aces.You still beat me.5-7, why would youeven play that hand?Sometimes it's betterto run good than play good.Unbelievable.Hey, I can't help it if I gotthe luck of the Irish in me.All right, easy, MacTiernan.You're not that luckyall the time.You sure about that?Or you forget about that moneythat I took from youlast week with my full house.I'm not talking about cards.What are you talking about then?Women.Are you serious?He's kidding, right?I'm the only one who can stillgo out and get lucky.The rest of you have to go hometo your wives.Except Matt.Hey, she hasn't signedthe divorce papers yet.Besides, this is not about me.Look, we all know thatyou've dated lots of women,but none of themhave gone anywhere.And thankfully so,'cause I don't wantto get caught upin that whole marriage mess.Well, what if you meet the one?Please.Stu, you think Bev is the one?The girl of your dreams?Well... that's whatshe keeps telling me.OK, look, all I'm saying is,doesn't matterif you meet the one or not.She would nevermarry you anyway.What makes you say that?Well, you're notmarriage material.- What?- You're the guy that girls datebefore they get married.You know, the fun guy.That's not true.I am fun.Aiden, you got commitment-phobewritten all over you, buddy.Girls can smell thata mile away.Well, maybe I just don't thinkthat kind of forever loveis possible.Aiden, face it, you couldnever get a girl to commit.That's ridiculous.Of course I could.- Really?- Yeah.You wanna bet?You get a girl to say "yes"to your marriage proposalby Christmas,and I will give youmy corner office.Lose...And you have to takeCharlie's cubicle.- Sweet.- That's crazy.Crazy 'cause, what,you don't think you can do it?I mean, you've never run awayfrom a bet before.No, it's crazy becauseChristmas is justfour weeks away.Hey, Svetlana said yesafter four weeks.Charlie,she was getting deported.Hey, man, look, it's cool.If you don't thinkyou can win this one,- just say so.- I'll do it.Beg your pardon?But I have to choose the girl.Done and doner, my friend.You are on.All right, OK, let's play.- Matt, you're on.- Matt, we're on you.Hey!Sorry.Are you busy?Just getting ready for a job.Someone dropped theirwedding ring down a drain.Mike, I am so sorry.I know, I should havenever let it get this far.You and my family and everyonewent through so much trouble,and your proposal,in a stadium, in front of50,000 people, I mean...How could a girl say "no,"right?You didn't.Well...I probably should have.- Here.- Keep it.- No, Mike, I-I can't.- Just...Hang on to it.You don't have to wear itif it freaks you out too much.Just keep it.You never know.Maybe with a little time,you'll change your mind.Mike, I'm pretty surewe're not meant to be together.But you can't be that sure.You almost made itdown the aisle.Well, you did,you just didn't stop is all.- Yeah.- Listen, my company just gota contract for the city.You know what that means.Foot in the door, security,more contracts.Eventually, a health

things, OK?So just bring your "a" game,buddy.I always do.- See you tonight.- See you tonight.- You kept the ring?- He wouldn't take it back,and I've hurt him enoughalready.Jess, you have got to stopsaying yes to these guysjust so you won't hurttheir feelings,'cause guess what?You're gonna hurt them anyway.You know me.I hate confrontation.Look, if a guy asks youto marry himon a 100-foot Jumbotron,that's the risk he's willingto take at public humiliation.All right.You've gotta learnto be more assertive.- You've got to just say "no".- No.- Good.- Thanks.So you're gonna givethe ring

He's just,second cubicle over.Thank you.Excuse me.So, anyhoo,we are probably gonna belooking for some backup dancers,if you guys are into it.Do you go-go?There you are.Mrs. Patterston,what are you doing here?I'm just checking my instincts.Look, I saw the way you lookedat Jessie the other night,and believe me,after three engagements,my radar is pretty astute.Now, do you reallywant to marry Jessie?Yes. Yes,of course, I do.Well, great!Then let's plan a wedding.How?Jessie, she doesn't wantto have anything to do with me,and I don't blame her.The bet, did you win it?No, once I realizedhow much I cared for her,I called it off.What's the best waythat you can show Jessiethat you meant itwhen you said yes?And the betmeant nothing at all?Marry her.Marry her!OK, who's hungry?Merry Christmas, Spencer.Good boy.Hey, Jimmy!Merry Christmas, buddy.There you go.Lincoln!Santa's gonna bring youa good home, buddy.And Jake?Think dad'll be wearinghis cheesy Christmas sweater?I don't know, it was lookingpretty snug last year.Merry Christmas, girls.Dad!- Look at you!- Snazzy!Right this way.Come on in.What happened to the sweater?Somebody hid itbehind the furnace.Now I will take these.You girls just go right oninto the living room please.Reverend Macey?What are you doing here?Mom?What's... what's going on?Dad?OK, if this is some sort ofweird intervention, I...Jessie.Jessie, wait.There's somethingI need to tell you.Here? Now?On Christmas day?You already admittedthat you used me as a pawn.You're right.I did choose youas the one to place my bet on,and even thoughit was a lousy bet to place,I don't regret it.Because I neverwould have met you.Jessie,you made me realizethat I'd ratherface my fear of commitmentthan be without you.Because you're right.When you truly love someone,the thought of spendingthe rest of your life with themshould make you feelthe happiest you've ever been.And that's exactly how I feltthe day you proposed to me.I just... Hopethat you feel the same.Jessie Patterston...Will you marry me?I...- Jake?- Hey, boy.You adopted Jake?I figured two troublemakers arebetter off together than alone.Yes.You j... you just said yes.Yes, she said yes.Yes that you'll marry me?Yes.I will marry you.She said yes!Hey!I love you.It's beautiful.Hey, boy.Yeah, that's it.Let's just get right to it.Do you, Aiden MacTiernan,take Jessie Patterstonto be your lawfully wedded wife,to love her and honor her,so long as you both shall live?I do.Do you, Jessie Patterston,take Aiden MacTiernanto be your lawfullywedded husband,to love him and honor him,so long as you both shall live?I do.I now pronounce youhusband and wife.You may now kiss the bride.We did it.We did.We went all-in.Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas, my husband.
